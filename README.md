This project proposes a sentiment analysis system designed to classify patient feedback on
healthcare services. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system aims to
understand patient sentiments (positive or negative) and provide actionable insights for
healthcare providers. The process involves selecting an existing sentiment analysis dataset
(e.g., from Twitter, Reddit, Google Reviews), followed by data pre-processing steps like
cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization to ensure high-quality input for model training.
This approach not only addresses the need for better patient experience management but also
provides measurable outcomes that can be validated against real-world feedback sources.
