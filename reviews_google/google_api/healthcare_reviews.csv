Dornalee Browne,1,"I am really disappointed once again in the service at this hospital. My advice is donâ€™t go alone and always ask questions.

My family member came in at midnight did the usual checks and then required an ultrasound. Around 4am I asked what was happening with the test. It was only then that they informed me that there is NO ultrasound technician at night and we had to wait till 7am when they open. So if I had not asked I would not know this.

So at  7:45am we were still waiting in a VERY cold hallway, So I asked again and they said they donâ€™t open till 8am and we wouldnâ€™t see anybody till 9am.

I waited again and asked again at 9am and they FINALLY decided to call and said itâ€™s another 30 mins!!!!  Keep in mind that they required a full bladder for this procedure and my family member was waiting since before 7am. How do they think itâ€™s humanly possible to hold it this long???

Then next door to wear we were waiting is the X-ray office. People were coming from the fracture clinic and nobody knew where to go. They have  no clear distinct signsâ€¦ just a small sign on a cart. I had to direct everyone where to put their files and where to wait. How is this efficient!?!

While I did meet one exceptional nurse, the experience here was less than pleasant.

We are starting not to feel well because they made us wait in the coldest area ever! I hear even the workers complain about it  but nobody did anything to change it!

Still waitingâ€¦. (And itâ€™s after 10:30am!!!!!!!!!!!)ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

So much for coming for an emergency in an ambulance! We did not get emergency service!"

Friendly staff.

Paid parking, Hard to find parking at times.

Few Tim Hortons within hospital.

So much construction around the hospital area."
Pavlina Zhekova,3,"Triage, ER doctors and nurses at RAFT were great. So nice, so helpful, and efficient. The doctor saw me 30 min after the triage and then 30 min after test results were ready and I was discharged. Not sure who is running this place, but for the 5 hours I spent there, I think there is a huge problem with the ultrasound and scan departments. I was waiting someone to take me to the ultrasound room over 3 hours, almost 4 hours. Someone came to take me for ultrasound only after the nurse called them to ask as I was waiting over 4 hours. There were people waiting for scanners over 4 hours. This is unacceptable and inefficient. I couldn't understand were there any technicians at all in the morning or they just work inefficiently as when I arrived early in the morning, there were only 5 other patients and wasn't busy at all."
Sue Z,1,Wait time For a Doctor is so long. Good luck getting a bed there isn't any. Good luck getting into surgery if you're in an emergency situation.There's no surgeons.The place is just overloaded and nobody there cares. So you think our health care system is bad? You haven't seen anything until you go into this hospital and need help.
