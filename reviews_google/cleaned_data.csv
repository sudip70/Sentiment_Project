I remembered changing his emergency contact the last time he was here few years ago and they haven‚Äôt change it until he was admitted.

My father was taken well care however, my father complained to me couple times there were staff members who were not nice when his food was given. My father stated, they were ‚Äúrude‚Äù.

I work seven days a week unable visit my father during the days and couldn‚Äôt be unable to speak with the doctors, I simply asked the nurses, the front desk to at least update me his conditions and I simply don‚Äôt understand why they could not call me as I am overwhelmed and frustrated by how the service went. I am unpleased by their customer service as it is quite poor.

The day of my father‚Äôs discharge, no doctors, no nurses and front desk did not bother calling me. And now, I am beginning to loose patience because no one did not call me/tell me what he is restricted of his diet and what he has to do to get better.

My family member came in at midnight did the usual checks and then required an ultrasound. Around 4am I asked what was happening with the test. It was only then that they informed me that there is NO ultrasound technician at night and we had to wait till 7am when they open. So if I had not asked I would not know this.

So at  7:45am we were still waiting in a VERY cold hallway, So I asked again and they said they don‚Äôt open till 8am and we wouldn‚Äôt see anybody till 9am.

I waited again and asked again at 9am and they FINALLY decided to call and said it‚Äôs another 30 mins!!!!  Keep in mind that they required a full bladder for this procedure and my family member was waiting since before 7am. How do they think it‚Äôs humanly possible to hold it this long???

Then next door to wear we were waiting is the X-ray office. People were coming from the fracture clinic and nobody knew where to go. They have  no clear distinct signs‚Ä¶ just a small sign on a cart. I had to direct everyone where to put their files and where to wait. How is this efficient!?!

While I did meet one exceptional nurse, the experience here was less than pleasant.

We are starting not to feel well because they made us wait in the coldest area ever! I hear even the workers complain about it  but nobody did anything to change it!

I believe there is a systemic issue to cause the extremely long wait time at the ED. Most of the doctors and nurses here did what they could. Expect being kept there for over 18 hrs, overnight. Even if your family physician called ahead of time and the hospital had confirmed that they had specialists on call, I just learned that ‚Äúon-call‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean he/she will come in the middle of the night. Very likely as a patient by the time when your results are back you are being kept in the ER for overnight as the specialists only come early in the morning. By the way, you don‚Äôt have a bed to lie down unless it‚Äôs a really really terrible situation- god forbid. Again, I think there is an issue in the Canadian healthcare system.

Some doctors and nurses here talk with an attitude, human flaws, we all have those in one way or another. However, what I‚Äôm trying to build up to is kudos to the triage nurse John - exceptional professional, calm, patient, attentive.

i left the hospital feeling a lot more suicidal and upset that they didn't care about my wellbeing. 2 days later, i went to CAMH's emergency department because i almost took my life. i was seen there much faster, the nurses were very attentive, and i was admitted the next day to one of their inpatient units.

Every single one of the staff was very good. My nurse even made me smile with her wit which eased my stress and really helped the situation. Then I went for a stress test in Cardiology and there was a little older lady there named Sophie.
She was in my mind unstable. She came at me with a razor and shaved half my chest telling me she needed to put the pads on so as to monitor my heart. Meanwhile I had pads on for the last 24 hours in 3 different areas. Then she started insisting that I wear a mask to get on the treadmill for the stress test. I felt this was not only unnecessary as no one in the whole place was wearing masks but also dangerous for a person with chest tightness and some shortness of breath already. Then she proceeded to speed the treadmill up at a very quick pace completing the hour long test in a matter of minutes. I had a heck of a time breathing after the incident. Some of the other staff even made faces at her and were telling her how to do her job so they obviously knew there was a problem with this person.

First of all, I will be forever indebted to Dr. Shahideh and Dr. Wilson for their expertise, experience and confidence to do what they do.
At pre-op I was looked after by a friendly and hard-working nurse named Jennifer who managed to juggle at least 6 other patients who were scheduled for surgery that morning with efficiency and a sense of humour.
I do not know the names of the nurses who assisted in the operating room but I would like to thank them for contributing to my successful surgery.
At post-op a wonderful nurse named HP was compassionate and very attentive to my needs.
I was transferred to the 1J Orthopaedic floor where I was initially taken care of by a nurse named Marian who was very caring, patient and knowledgeable.
Overnight, I was looked after by an amazing and compassionate nurse named Halyna. I had the good fortune to have her assigned to me for two nights. She was like a super hero who was always not far away and made sure I was comfortable. She  expertly found a vein in my wrist to re-insert my IV after I inadvertently removed it. She carried out her duties with a quiet confidence and good-natured attitude.
The next two days I was very fortunate to be looked after by two incredible nurses named Rose and Raman. Rose was so warm and caring with a beautiful sunny demeanor who always seemed to be smiling while caring out her responsibilities very efficiently. She was always very caring and patient. Raman was also very caring, calm and patient and made me feel like I was being looked after by a seasoned nurse with years of experience except she had not even fully graduated to RN status yet as she was days away from graduating. She will be a wonderful asset to this hospital for years to come.
Overnight, I was looked after by another wonderful and hard-working nurse named Carolina who was very professional and always not far away.  I felt I was always in good care under her watch.
Throughout my stay I was visited by a wonderful stream of nurses, doctors and physician assistants especially Mario Haroon who patiently answered and explained all my queries. They made sure I had everything I required and really put me at ease.
I would also like to thank the physical therapists who were very patient and knowledgeable and occupational therapist Kristen for her expert care, knowledge and positive demeanor.

For those of you who have read previous reviews on this site, you can see that my review and experience was much more positive than the others. I believe that this is because the hospital is making a concerted effort to improve overall conditions, staffing and patient care. They are on the right track!

He was very helpful and oh so pleasant.
Check in was done in seconds and wait time to be called in was only minutes.
Once my husband was assigned a bed to get ""ready "" for his surgery we were introduced to his nurse whom I'm sure her name was Leslie.  She was wonderful full of information and so kind especially with my husband being terrified of what was to come. She assured us everything would be fine and she would see us when he was finished.  We then met the surgeon, Dr. Lee who wad also very reassuring.  The nurse who started the IV was an absolute riot trying to calm my husband down and make the whole process fun even when it wasn't. After surgery I was informed immediately how everything went by Dr. Lee and was called by the day surgery unit when he woke up. Not long after he was discharged and wheeled out to me in the waiting car.

We cannot say enough how lovely and helpful the staff here was. I hope anyone needing some kind of surgery or hospital care can go here.  My local hospital could learn a lot from this facility

I have been taking my father there at the cardiac clinic for years now and have always had a good experience here for his pacemaker. My mother spent a few weeks here and it was always a good experience the nurse's were polite and kind, professional and understanding as I would visit  her often for dementia diagnostic and assessment they adjusted her meds and way home for a few year now and she past away September last year after 15 years of battling it (88 years old) and she had nothing but praise for her treatment there. My last stay there for seizures post  operation and after radiation treatment at Princess Margerit they treated me very well and I am so grateful to the nurses and doctors there I got a C.A.T. scan so they  adjusted my meds and sent findings to neurologist,  radiologist and family doctor very professional and organized specifically during these trying times with the added inconvenience of covid. This hospital serves a large area and is far better than many other hospitals such as St Joseph health center or West Park health center and Humber River Hospital, Credit valley hospital as I have been to all of them and more and I defenetly feel safe and secure at this hospital. I would definitely recommend this hospital without reservation and give it high praise. the  only issue is finding parking of course like most hospitals in G.T.A. area.
