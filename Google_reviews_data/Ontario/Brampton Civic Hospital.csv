My appointment was scheduled for 2:40 AM, a time that proved to be incredibly peaceful and quiet, which added to the overall positive experience. The staff was exceptionally helpful, guiding me through the process with care and professionalism. The MRI itself was straightforward and much easier than I anticipated. I left feeling well taken care of and grateful for the smooth experience at such an odd hour. Highly recommend!"

She was dismissive, condescending, and lacked basic customer service skills, making the experience unnecessarily hostile for patients.

Was moved to the respirology dept on Saturday. Then spend three nights in a bed in the hallway. Have you ever tried sleeping in a hallway with movement all night. Bright lights etc?  The staff couldn’t have been nicer. But the hospital is too small for Brampton’s needs now that we have grown. They keep bringing people into Brampton but out services have not kept paced. I have a lot of kudos too. The food has definitely improved. The staff are terrific. The nurses caring. So all in all my 8 day staff could have been better in a room. But I can’t fault the staff who were kindness itself. Now mayor Brown it’s up to you. We need another hospital.

The administration staff upon registration were wonderful.  I received a thorough checkup and the tests were done.  Yes my wait was long but the examination and follow up were thorough. The doctor listened to my concerns and ordered the appropriate tests. I thought I had a kidney stone
(initial diagnosis at urgent care a few days prior) and ended up having pneumonia. The hospital is also a beautiful facility and very clean from my observations. We may need additional facilities to keep up with the growing population but Brampton Civic is a great start.

Thank you to all the staff at Brampton Civic ER."

Leaving with no cast or boot because I have insurance and a health card, but no money.  The hospital doesn't want to bill the insurance company. What's the point of having a hospital.

Personally I wish that no one need to visit hospital for any wrong reason. We visited the place for our ultrasound. It took us 3 weeks to find the slot.

The hospital is well maintained and clean. We took early morning appointment (7:30 am) so it was not busy. Staff at diagnostic centre was very helpful. The process was quick and smooth.

I think emergency section is stretch right now owing to high demand.

Parking is little expensive and it costed us around $9 for one hour."

Grandfather who was admitted for more than 2 weeks because they kept delaying the biopsy. Doctor kept saying it will be In the next one to two days and it’s been a week. The nurses are extremely rude and slow. Everytime my grandpa need so to go to the washroom, we had to call the nurse to remove his iv bag. They took too long to come and my grandpa ended up peeing his pants and when they finally did showed up they blamed my grandpa for not being able to hold it. On top of that, when you ask the doctor for updates he doesn’t know anything just tries to run away. ( Dr. Kumar). I asked him multiple times to give us daily updates because my grandpa has a serious condition, but he never does and from the past two weeks, I’ve only seen him once, and when you try to talk to him, he gives you attitude and just walks away.

The behavior and attitude of the hospital staff were extremely unprofessional and rude. It was evident that the staff lacked the necessary knowledge and skills to provide adequate patient care.

I urge the higher authorities to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. It is vital that the hospital staff are held accountable for their actions and that measures are put in place to improve the quality of care provided.

Psychiatrists seem to have their own agenda and use same generic medication on every patient, doesn't give a damn about children and literally gave me multiple panic attacks. Accused me of self harm when I was picking at scars due to anxiety but didn't seem to want to help my root issue. The actual unit was nice but locking kids out of their rooms seriously??? And forcing them to walk around the unit in circle for 15 minutes everyday. School there was torture since I was depressed and couldn't process things. They didn't communicate very well with me about my treatment and were restrictive on what I could have. PICU was even worse, literally yelled at for being in pain and refusing medications that weren't helping. Being accused of lying about an attempt (despite how I had to undergo medical treatment) is no joke and should be taken seriously. The ER wasn't too bad except every time I went I was stripped of my belongings, left in a room by myself with nothing and always had security watching me. The guards would literally mock me for not being violent and barely paid attention to me. The nurses in the ER were way better than the inpatient unit however. Triage was easy and nurses were great, did take a while to wait but wasn't too long. I wouldn't recommend this hospital but was forced to go for mental health assessment and due to me living in brampton other hospitals wouldn't treat me instead they would transfer me here.

I just want to say that if they know that ultrasound doesn’t work as good as CT scan then why waste time and not do the right thing in the first time.

I can only speak to the emergency rooms and their workers. This review does not reflect other departments due to my lack of experience with them.

**AVOID AT ALL COSTS!** If you're reading this before going to an emergency room, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere to save time and possibly your own health.

While there are a handful of competent, caring, and hard-working nurses, they are overwhelmed by the lack of urgency and poor communication from their coworkers. The overall environment suffers from:

1. Lack of Communication: Nurses often fail to explain why certain procedures, like blood work or IVs, are necessary. There is also a tendency to repeat tests that have already been conducted, indicating a severe communication breakdown.

2. Professional Competence: Without questioning the professional skill set of some staff, it’s clear that there is a significant disparity in the level of care provided. Basic procedures and follow-ups are frequently mishandled or overlooked.

3. Wait Times and Scheduling Issues: I spent 10 hours waiting to speak with a specialist, only to wait an additional 6 hours before being transferred to an OR room. The scheduled operation was then pushed back without any communication.

Despite understanding that emergencies are unpredictable, the complete lack of communication and the constant struggle to obtain basic information made the experience frustrating and disheartening.

For your own sake, seek emergency care elsewhere."

Ignored her for the entire night and most of the day. Absolutely no integrity, horrible nurses, that barely do the basics of their job. And this is on top of the overall state of the hospital, it’s horribly dirty, a tuberculosis penitentiary from the 1800s would be in better shape than this place. If you, or anyone you know, has to go to a hospital, make sure you go literally anywhere else. A walk-in clinic would be 100 times more helpful than this poor excuse for a hospital."

Was in the UCC waiting room until 6:30pm.

Saw the doctor at 6:50pm. The nurse came at 7pm as she was running around gathering first aid supplies.

Clearly, the patient rooms are not well stocked with supplies.

She took 10 minutes and did her best with what she had. My bandage fell off right after I walked out of the room.

I spent 3 hours waiting for 15 minutes of care which is unacceptable.

Cons
Lack of staff communication and team work

Disorganized supplies and staff

EXTREMELY long wait times (3 hours)

PRO
Doctor is thorough.
He takes the time to get all the facts.

Long wait times and slow service are evidence of the lack of team work. No one really knew their role (within the team) and was doing their own thing.

Do yourself a favour and save time, go to another clinic or at off peak hours after 10pm."

Time and time again I have been blown by the genuine care the entire team has provided in this hospital.
We’ve had two serious hospitalizations within our family in the past 2 months. My husband was hospitalized for acute heart failure and my mother-in-law for gangrene in her toe.
My husband was admitted in CCU for more than a week and the team out there provided him superb service. My mother-in-law was in ATC, had a surgery done and then moved to rehab. She was provided amazing care.
What stands out the most in terms of patient care is that the staff is never pushing the patient to be discharged prematurely, they ensure that the patient has well recovered before they are ready to go. The doctors and  nurses take the time to keep the family informed of the progress of the patient.

Firstly, I had a midwife with whom was handling my overall birth. However, the experience was very traumatic as I wasn’t progressing well in labour, therefore, the on call OB had to be consulted. Dr. Suleman was consulted and advised to keep me at a certain level and not surpass that level for my induction medication, as there are more risks for myself and my baby.  However, another OB was consulted, Dr. Persad who was willing to up the medication and put myself and my baby at risk, in order to rush my labour. Which to this day I don’t understand why both OBs have a different opinion.

Dr.Persad’s bedside manner is very disrespectful and condescending. My husband and mother were trying to privately discuss what course of action we should take moving forward, and she said “not to whisper as she couldn’t hear”

My end result was a c-section for which she operated. The support staff during my c section especially the anesthesiologist were AMAZING! Very comforting, and told me step by step what was happening to help decrease my anxiety.

Once I was moved to the post partum ward the first nurse I encountered was Melissa who was very aggressive. I had just gone through major abdominal surgery, and she was forcing breastfeeding on me, and everytime it hurt or felt uncomfortable, rather then guiding me, she made me feel helpless.

The next day I had the absolute pleasure of having Geraldine as my nurse. She is amazing. She looked after me more than I could ask for, and I appreciate it. She even came the day after when she wasn’t my nurse just to check up on me. After a traumatic experience it’s nice to know that some nurses sympathize and care about their patients.

The NICU nurses are exceptional! Specially Raveena, Natalia, and Surinder!! They made my husband and I feel comfortable as our baby was treated in the NICU for 2 days. Kept our spirits up, taught us feeding, burping, diaper changing and bathing techniques, and as new parents helped us feel more confident!

All in all my experience was amazing postpartum thanks to the nursing and NICU staff. Labour itself could use a lot of work especially in bed side manners."

It’s no way a patient should be treated especially after being here due to no fault of their own.

I rather be at home or a different hospital but the are uncaring to their own patients and have don’t use there own brain to understand that sometimes logic is a bit more reasonable that black and white rules that are very inconvenient."

There was lot of delay between processes like waiting for blood work, urine, and ultrasound. It is not that they are under staffed or something. They take forever to do anything and communicate with different teams. Unreasonable wait times make you feel like you are getting world’s worst service. The care for patient and their needs does not exist. These are fixable problems and it needs right intention.

If i could i would never come back to this hospital. I would rather pay than to get this bad service.

Canada needs to either privatize hospitals or have enough hospitals according to population size. Right now, we are very far behind the demand.

Lazy people at hospitals should be fired and deserved hard working people should get the opportunity.

William Osler systems should take our feedback and do something about their hospitals. The day we will have a choice, we will not come back ever."

If someone needs to lay down  for a procedure,, get a stretcher put a curtain around it and do the non invasive procedure. Ie. catheter  No need to wait hours for Acute section.  Then bog that area down with a person who didn’t need a room to begin with.

IER waiting room you can start bloodwork, get urine samples. Would help ACT section from being bogged down. Maybe not all cases but certainly with some you could do this.

Doctor’s are great, but system within ER is not efficient at least from our experience. Hope it changes as they have great doctor’s.

No one in hospital able to get any information which doctor should I contact for further follow up no one answered on phone visit several times to 2nd floor patient clinic and 3rd floor patient care no one answered who to contact just give the number which already declined the referral request.

197 OVER 120 BLOOD PRESSURE
AFTER TALKING OVER THE PHONE WITH SOMEONE WHO CALLED ME FROM HOSPITAL WHO DID NOT WANT JUST LISTEN TO MY EXPERIENCE, JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR DID, BUT NOT REALLY DO. OR WHAT HAPPENED BUT NOT REALLY.
THEY SAID HE TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE 2 REFERRALS.... NO HE TOLD ME OVER THE PHONE SOME WOULD CALL ME ABOUT MY MRI RESULTS BECAUSE OF ABNORMAL RESULTS.

THEY CALL ME AND TRY TO TELL ME WHAT WENT WRONG, OR THEY TRY TO TELL ME WHAT SOMEONE TOLD ME, WHEN THEY DID NOT(or only half of the issue) HOW CAN THEY FIX THE PROBLEM IF THEY DON'T KNOW ALL THE FACTS.

THEY SAY THEY ARE TYRIG TO FIX THE PROBLEMS, BUT THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT THE DOCTOR AND HIS COMMUNICATION WITH THE PHARMACIST, AND NOT THE ISSUE WITH THE NURSES OR THE PATIENTS EXPERIENCE OR ITS AN ON GOING ISSUE OR TRYING TO DISMSS MY CONCERNS.  THE FACT I HAD TO RUN BACK AND FORTH TO THE HOSPITAL.  I'M PISSED OFF, ALL THEY NEED TO IS LISTEN AND NOT SAVE FACE.........

So many complaints aside from not dying. FROM over 220 blood pressure when admitted generally took care of me aside from details below. Nurses were ok, I did not care as I wanted be left alone. Could not relax and sleep from all the noises, suggest ear plugs and eye coverings. Telling me I was sleeping when I wasn't, I slept maybe 4-hours total based on watching clock.
1- Badly  organized  building. FOR SIMPLE preventable mistakes- if I die malpractice 100% making me walk around the building
2- the signage to get to one point to another is horrible.  Can't exit any doors after 10pm, no security there at all.  NO SIGNAGE AT ALL to exit the doors you want to get to get picked up by family members.    Let out by someone at an entrance at the other end of the building I wanted or thought I was. Wandering the outside in my blood pressure.
DIRECTION FROM EVERY CLOSED EXIT TO EMERGENCY EXIT NEED TO BE IN PLACE.  MAPS. DIRECTIONAL SIGNAGE ON WALL DO NOT MAKE SENSE.  NOTES ON DOORS
3 PRESCRIPTIONS NOT BEING ABLE TO FILLED by pharmacist BECAUSE MISSING INFORMATION AND CONFLICTING NOTES BY DOCTOR AND NURSES PHARMACIST CAN FILL OR TELL ME DOSAGE.
THIS WAS AND IS SOMETHING told by pharmacy, that I was not the only person coming that the hospital was doing to, that other patients come in already they could not fill out and info was missing or was conflicting
4.Being told I was being discharged by nurse suddenly, after doctor said I was to stay over night if blood pressure improves. Then taken suddenly to imaging after being told I need to come to do it later in a few days.  After I had just arranged to be picked up.  Then being left after imaging was done for 2hrs -15min waiting, Holding my urine for 24hrs the nurse told me I could leave after I relieved myself. But they submitted anyways,
After 2hrs waiting I was going to make my own way back to the room walking but the porter was walking back as I was leaving.
5. waiting to get a call back form doctor as I need to confirm what meds I should be taking.
6.not clearly understood prescription told by pharmacist, who said to confirm doses. The nurse
7- stressed and agitated from being told I was being sent hone at 4pm, to being kept back till and leaving at 8pm to returning at 10pm to the hospital to get confirmation about meds to be filled and no Doctor available to see me, Nurses were confused and could not explain or get a doctor on staff to review my prescription.
pharmacy filled the prescription but could not tell me what I need to take(all or some)......that it won't kill me if I take all, But I need to confirmation what I should be takin and it could result in my blood pressure to drop too low etc...(was sorted out but still going to confirm this confusion because they blaming each other)

MESS I just want confirmation from why one doctor changed things form the other.  Trusting the original over the other."

Learn to effectively communicate, have some empathy and be patient while your patient is trying to answer your questions especially when there’s a language barrier. Your job skills includes to be empathetic and have effective communication - if the patient isn’t being difficult why are you making the experience and process so difficult?

Most of the Staff is incredibly rude, no regard for patient comfort or their accompanying family. My grandma has back, heart, chest issues - and cannot sit for
That long. The least we wanted was a bed for her to lay down on while we were waiting, nada. The number of people that came in after us and got seen before us is ridiculous. When we finally got moved to the acute centre, we're waiting again for doctor, and then waiting some more for imaging/testing. The board or management needs to SERIOUSLY ASSESS their staff count and who they hire. I saw an interaction between a paramedic and a patient who was bleeding a lot through their nose, and the paramedic just said ""wait till they call your name"" turned around, scoffed and rolled His eyes. How are you in this profession and be like that? I highly recommend, go ANYWHERE else but here.

And to William Osler - Don't even bother responding to this comment. All you write is to contact your patient experience line. You do not need people to call that line to know how patient experience is. These google reviews say more than enough about the experience. People want CHANGES, they want something to actually come from these complaints. Not you just logging them away and going on with your day.

P.S. Still at the hospital, 6 hours later. we'll see how long this takes

The speed and attention I received during my visit were impressive. It's essential for people to approach hospitals with a positive attitude and remember that the staff here is not just providing medical care but also delivering exceptional customer service. This balance is not easy to achieve, and Civic Brampton Hospital does it remarkably well.

I have one year Medical floor experience. I'm reading the comments here and it's disheartening. I'm telling myself that I could learn from this. I'm trying to take it with a balanced perspective coming from both a member of the community and also as a medical staff. I will do my best to educate myself to learn my job well. To get into ED there's batteries of test and courses: 2 weeks in class education, a month clinical; Medical Directives, Arrhythmia Interpretation tests; within 6mos- Cardiology 1 (Rhythm Interpretation) and ACLS; by the next year if you are fortunate enough to stay on- TNCC and Resuscitation. ENPC to be better at Pediatrics. Emergency Nursing Certificate is highly recommended, I will try to complete this. Etc. We also have huddles to remind us of our shortcomings and also not often but of what we did right. Our managers continually take surveys and rallys for us to do better.

We have excellent educators, an excellent manager, we work and support each other as a Team. Most of the doctors are very kind and considerate. Most of my colleagues are very kind, helpful, supportive, humble and kind hearted. You should see the level of dedication my colleagues have, you don't get reimbursed for courses you failed etc. ER nurses get paid the same as floor nurses. I try not to be disheartened by the bad reviews, instead I want to face it with courage on how I can improve myself as a nurse. I'm hoping we could serve you better in a more timely fashion. If you are ambulatory, you are better off than many patients, there could be a long wait time. To my knowledge, BW and Xray results are very fast, CT scan can be a few hours, MRI might take a day or two, your doctor have to pull a lot of strings to do this Stat. Only doctors can tell you your results and diagnosis. Doctors hours are usually 9- 5. On call shift changes at 8. I could be wrong.

If the patient is crashing almost everyone runs. It's easier to see the negatives in situations and even people, sadly. But no one would deliberately want to do a bad job. We all want to serve people and be part of their health care. We are here primarily to save lives. Please use our health care responsibly, you are part of the team. Health Care is not free, we all pay.. half my wages goes to taxes. If healthcare is privatized, I don't think I could afford it. I'm very grateful for every blessings and graces I receive.    I aspire to be of service to others and to leave this world knowing I was part of making it a better place. With a little less viral misery. Attitude adjustments are welcome, no is acceptable, wait is also ok. I hope you could also have compassion for the lowly healthcare workers that aim to serve you. Compassion is also give and take. Respect also has to be mutual. I also receive health services, I get it. I will do better.

I love my colleagues, I'd do anything within my ability to make their day a bit better."

From being left in a room for over an hour while I’m bleeding all over the stretcher to waiting in the hallway for over 7 days to get a room, others of their background just get one after waiting a couple of hours. Laughing at you when you ask what’s going on cause they really couldn’t care less as they know what’s up. I’ve sat here and watched how they segregate people. Certain races get their own rooms and others are placed together. Just walk down a wing and you’ll see for yourself. Openly practicing segregation, and discrimination. Disgusting. While the doctors and a handful of nurses are nice but many nurses there don’t care about their jobs or patients. Constantly lying about when you’ll get a bed all the while I see beds available and they just make excuses. I never knew it took 6 hours to clean a bed and area in a shared room. Or being told that yes a bed is available at 12n, (No ones in it) but you won’t get it till next day?? The only thing that I’ve seen is when someone makes up noise and causes a code white things get done.

I have never felt so much negligence from a health care system where, people in this field seem to be numb to other people’s pain. It did not help me to go to EMERGENCY, please find another hospital for your injuries and needs as the doctors speak to patients with no empathy and care.

IN FACT: I didn’t not even get to speak with a doctor or see anyone for my serious injury that could possibly lead to serious complications or worst case death.

It really doesn't help at all, you’re usually in your room with nothing to do. Talking to other kids while unsupervised gets you put on behavioural protocol, they basically force you to stay in your room for 24 hours.

I have been in a shared room where the bathroom has not been cleaned in several days with towels, feces and urine all over the floor. The call bell for the nurse's attention is useless as the response time is very slow, but, you are able to hear them in the hallway shouting laughing and gossiping while the patient is waiting in pain or distress. Nobody has responded to any of the concerns I have brought up, but have told me that your queries have been passed on to the relevant people.  After having been a patient here for 4 weeks, I sent an email with these concerns and was told that the information will be passed on again.

Instead of offering support during a vulnerable moment, her comments, such as questioning why my sister-in-law was holding the bed and suggesting she should have anticipated the pain. She said why did you planned to have baby and so on.

I urge the management to address this issue promptly. Such behavior is unacceptable, and it's crucial for the hospital to ensure that all staff members are adequately trained in compassionate communication. I plan to contact the management on Monday to discuss this matter further.

I hope this feedback contributes to the improvement of the overall patient experience at your hospital."

Father is agitated with poop and soaked diaper on. Nurses should check patients diapers more often and not leave it for so many hours. Some nurses care and some don't. I'm not too happy with this hospital. One nurse pushed wheelchair table so tight on dad's stomach like a muffin top and being squeezed. It is good I came by. Another nurse tied/restrained dad wrists so tight, it was purple. If your family or friend is here, make sure to check up on them. Why be a nurse, if so rough and not caring?

Unfortunately, most of the nurses were not equipped to handle patients with dementia, causing confusion and discomfort for my mom. There was a constant turnover of new nurses, which further added to the confusion. Some nurses were negligent in their care, leaving feces on her bed covers and floor. Additionally, some nurses were defensive and unprofessional when questioned. The hospital's focus seemed to be on discharging patients rather than providing adequate care and therapy. This experience has highlighted systemic issues in our healthcare system, leaving me concerned for my own future and the treatment of the elderly."

My 82 year old mother has been battling a stage 3 cancer and unfortunately attempting to receive care at this facility. The staff are repeatedly condescending, rude , non-empathetic and quite frankly poorly skilled. My mother had a port implanted under her skin to enable the application of her chemo drugs due to her veins being too small or collapsed. NO ONE at this hospital has any idea how to properly administer her chemo with this port, for which she had to be referred to another facility to have the procedure done. She was provided with an instruction card and told by the provider who implanted the port to show it each time to anyone attempting to administer her chemo as a specific needle is required. This horrendous care team have repeatedly REFUSED, flat out REFUSED to review the instruction card for accurate application, telling her ""we know what we're doing"". On her most recent visit she pleaded with the attending nurse to read the card and ensure she was using the proper needle. The nurse responded ""this is the only one we have"" and showed her a different needle. As a result, it was a painful experience and she experienced a lot of bleeding. On another occasion, the attending nurse not only incorrectly administered the chemo in the port, the drug actually coursed through her entire body causing  blackening in various parts, bleeding and pain. A head nurse actually had the gall to ask my mother if she has a medical background when she complained about the improper administering of the drug. Unfortunately I am based in the US and unable to advocate in person for my mother.  We are in the process of raising a formal complaint with this hospital. Stay clear if you're able!!

Doug Ford stop bellowing  about how much funding you are putting into the hospital system. Most hospital workers know that a significant portion of that money goes to the fat bonuses of the Executive suite barely trickling down to actually spending money on more staff and equipment. If you are giving out bonuses to CEO's - base it on the feedback of the actual users of the hospital not on some efficiency cost cutting rating that negatively impacts service levels. Patrick Brown this hospital is in your city! Get involved and do something about the deplorable service levels.

I unfortunately had 2 ER visits recently, in May and June 2023.   Both times, the staff showed such lack of empathy and urgency to  my sons condition, in spite of him being visibly in severe pain.  It took 4 hours before he was seen by a doctor and given pain meds.  They put you in queue, and tend to you on a first come, first serve basis and not on the level of pain a person is in.  In addition,  the staff doing blood work, were not just impolite, but I noticed were  outright rude to another patient.     I would urge William Osler Health Care to pay attention to the numerous complaints and put some focus on training its staff on a key component of their job in health care, which is Empathy.   The ER staff is unfortunately giving a bad reputation to BC and rest of the staff at the hospital."

We came in at 9 PM and till 7 AM, no one has told us what was happening. The radiologist is WFH and forgot to respond back with a report for 6 hours. Only after two or three reminders has responded back. You are better off going to some other clinic. Ontario and Canada health at its best"

Go to another hospital close to Brampton like Georgetown, or a bit further like credit valley hospital in Mississauga but not this one.
They will treat you with no dignity and they won’t understand how urgent your case is if you have a real emergency case that would threaten your life.
Yesterday I went in an ambulance and they didn’t care how serious my case was, nurses refused to push the wheel chair to the washroom, I was heavily bleeding due to a miscarriage. They thought I am making all up. I had to leave and go to Mississauga where I was admitted immediately, although the emergency was very busy and many were waiting but I could lose my life if they didn’t take care of me immediately.
They found a bed for me, they called a doctor urgently and that doctor called a gynaecologist immediately and they treated my case. Nurses attitude were way better than the ones in Brampton, doctor were amazing in credit valley Mississauga hospital.

I was forced to buy the Air Cast wherein I mentioned that I already have one at home and they charged me $150 however when I saw the actual charge on the wall was $140. I really don’t know why have they charged me $10 extra ??

Later I got an appointment with the Fracture Specialist and the Dr.Rizek. He was so much in hurry like I had few questions. He gave me a booklet and asked to me to read and understand my pain and what steps to take further.

We got to the hospital at 9pm we got to front desk and told the lady what where here for and what happened and not an ounce of care or empathy in her eyes or tone it felt like I was at fish market picking up a number.

Next I went to the waiting room where we waiting 2 hours or so for the registration desk and our name was called. When we approached the nurse attending us was probably  the most rude and condescending person I have ever met! Either she is retiring tomorrow  or have lost her brain cells on how a little kindness and compassion could go a long way. The whole 10 mins was nothing but ignorant comments and rude tone and she didn't want to be there or do this job anymore. It was painful to watch thus lady be rude to other elderly people who didn't speak proper English.

After this we waited another 1 hour or so to be go into the waiting room PAZ.
We waited there probably 2 hours or so doctor came quickly checked and what happened and was pleasant and we stayed for another hour and got home 3am after check up and some kind of medication to stop 🤢.

Note to Hospital Management.
1) have your family and friends go undercover to this hospital and ask them how they felt and what their experience was if you don't believe us
2)Fire anyone who doesn't want to be there and hire people who actually want to be there and provide care
3)TEACH YOUR STAFF ESPECIALLY EMERGENCY STAFF TO BE MORE EMPATHATIC AND SHOW SOME KINDNESS...WERE NOT COMING HERE BECAUSE WE WANT WERE COMING BECAUSE WE NEED TO.

Sooner or later someone is going to lose it and people are going to get hurt.
You only need 1 person to say the wrong thing to thr wrong person at the wrong time and this hospital will be on the News.

Hope this hospital  takes these comments seriously and improves !"

Same night my wife discharged more than normal blood and felt a lot of pain and our baby wasn't feeling well as well, we called the nurse, our assigned nurse was on break, and the other nurse showed up, she was extremely rude and unprofessional.
