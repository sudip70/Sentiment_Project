I was admitted during day time nurse Eva was there. She was so kind and helpful. After her shift there were two nurses Nava and Saadat. Special shoutout to both of them. They were so knowledgeable and kind . Saadat is such a patient nurse felt like I was working with my sister. After their shift my nurse fely was like an experienced nurse she supported me a lot during my pushing. She is so good. And after that doctor tigert and some other doctors came to help me deliver and I am very thankful to them for giving me my bundle of joy safely . Post partum unit was also ok. Nd before I forget doctor who gave me anesthesia was also great …. Epidural worked really well for me

The two ladies on night shift and day shift nurse, Felicia were amazing. I think my birth experience was amazing because of them. Postpartum unit was ok. Pediatrics unit was extremely helpful and supportive. There were a few nurses that stuck out on day shift who went out of there way to show us a few tips and get me as much help as possibly with breastfeeding."

We brought my mother to the emergency department, and despite her obvious discomfort, she was left to wait in a hallway overnight. There was no sense of urgency, and no one seemed to care about her needs or well-being. My father had a similar experience in the past, so this is not an isolated issue—both times, the service was slow, inefficient, and downright disrespectful. The lack of compassion and professionalism was appalling. Honestly, I'd rather suffer at home than subject my loved ones to the terrible care we received here. It’s clear that this hospital needs a complete overhaul in how they treat patients and manage emergencies."

I delivered my first baby here on July 23. Aside from one nurse,  every person we met along the way was supportive and caring.  My nurse during labour and delivery was Hazel, and she was the biggest and best cheerleader I could have hoped for during that process.  She was also an advocate for me and got me the epidural as soon as I asked. Our first nurse in the mother baby unit was Sarah, and she was equally at amazing. She reassured me while starting to breastfeed and always had a smile on her face.  She repeatedly told us how great we were doing.

My one major complaint,  which patient relations are aware of,  was the nurse Joanne who was working in labour and delivery when admitted.  She was beyond rude and inappropriate,  and also judged the fact that I had to take antidepressants during my pregnancy.  Her conduct and behavior were unprofessional.  She could have really ruined the day had she been my nurse for the entire labour and delivery.  I hope that the hospital truly looks into her behavior,  because she is working with women who are experiencing the most vulnerable moments of their life, and the impact she has can be significant."

The triage wait was a little long but there were a lot of people there so it was expected.

Wait time to see a doctor wasn't terrible but what made this experience great was the fact that the nurses in the emergency department saw to it that I was given fluids and anti nausea medicine while I waited.

They checked on me often and I never once felt ignored or forgotten.  The doctor made the decision to bring me into the hospital as I wasn't able to keep anything down .

Spent 3 days in hospital and the care I was given was exemplary.  The nurses always greeted me cheerfully (I'm sure they were smiling under the mask you could hear it) and the listened to my questions.

I've been in emerge and in hospital multiple times and the level of care I get has always been wonderful.

I can't express how thankful I am for the care they showed me.  It's a great hospital with amazing nurses and doctors who genuinely care about the people in their care.

Wouldn't want to be anywhere else when I'm sick."

I gave birth to my baby boy last week and couldn’t have been more happy about my choice of hospital and the care provider I was assigned with!

However my postpartum nurse Jillian was beyond rude and obnoxious.
She had the attitude that she was the only one right in the room, everyone else was just stupid for even asking a question.
She got into constant arguments with my support person /family over frivolous things.
I went into sudden labour at 37 weeks so I was unprepared and  she judged me so hard for not having enough wet wipes. She really dampened my postpartum care & recovery."

Especially if you end up in the ER, be mentally prepared to spend 9-11 hours until you get the release papers from the doctor.

The good thing about this place is that there's a decent number of choices for food. There's also lots of food choices along with a decent number of shopping places at the northwest corner of Eglinton and Erin Mills Parkway (Erin Mills TownCentre). Such as The Bay, H&M, Lens Crafters, Old Navy, Natural Solutions, etc...

There's also a Canada Post in the same vicinity."

The way this hospital runs is awful. No honesty. They tell you come for 6:45 am, only to wait 2-3 hours. Why not just be honest and say 9:45.

I would say the nurses are really nice and so are the staff, but I think they should vocalize and manage expectations better. As in, just be extra kind to patients and tell them of the pitfalls of the hospital and how it works. Tell us, “hey be here at 645 but expect to be seen at 945 am”

The staff is good, but to be great, they should be more compassionate to patients and go the extra step to manage expectations.

The wait times really tick everyone off."

MRI department was professional and well laid out however I heard a nurse yelling at a patient for being deaf and not understanding the nurse. The nurse for my procedure inserting my IV was really patient with my anxiety.

When I came as a child and had to wait with my mum in the ER it was really scary and hard to find my mum had to beg a nurse to let me back in the ER, grateful I was able to find her and she was ok in the end

When I arrived by ambulance for an attempt in the middle of the night (with police) it was scary but a nurse took great care of me quickly. The nurses were really sweet and understanding when they moved me to the pediatric area of the ER all doctors and most nurses were nice. Did not appreciate nurses leaving me (a suicidal patient) alone in a room with so many potential weapons, attached to medical monitoring equipment (yet I was yelled at when I disconnected them to use the washroom), and a psychotic man running down the hallways yelling. They literally left me alone for hours upon hours with no help even when the equipment started beeping. I got little to no sleep as it was very loud even in the private room I had for a week. The mental health area of the ER is AWFUL. A girl was on the phone all night loudly complaining to a friend about her issue and the hospital being awful. She finally left but at least she had a choice. The washrooms were disgusting and I was stuck in a hallway on a bed with bright lights on at all times and loud noises everywhere. Psychotic people were hardly supervised and I was terrified as a child in that hallway. Nurses were a little rude there but otherwise good. I had to be transferred as credit valley doesn't treat pediatric mental health."

He was responsible for the merge of the 3 hospitals.  He was someone great. He was someone important. He made great change. People respected him.

Now, he is older and suffering, and nobody cares about him at all.  Especially not the hospital he helped build.  He’s getting the worst treatment and neglected constantly. Makes me sick. As his daughter. My brother just passed away this year. And also got the same terrible treatment at credit valley that my dad is getting now. Makes me sick."

Shie,3 weeks ago,"I usually never write reviews but I had to write one for the awful experience I had at the hospital. Even though most of the staff is nice, the process the patient goes through is absolutely terrible. From waiting room to waiting room, me and my partner had to wait for more than 5 hours (when their estimates said we would wait for 2 and when they told us there were only 2 patients ahead of us waiting to see a doctor). It feels like the patient’s time is not respected at all which is really frustrating. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."

Dr. Jamal and his surgical team were outstanding - they were not only skilled and professional but also compassionate, which helped ease my nerves before the procedure.

After surgery, I spent 5 hours trying to wake up in the recovery room. The nurse was incredibly patient with me, since 5 hours is an exceptionally long amount of time to become lucid. She even made sure to call my anxious family from the recovery room seeing as I had taken so long to wake up and be released. She came afterwards to see me in my regular room to ask how I am feeling.

Afterwards, I spent three days in the 1A surgery recovery unit, and the care I received was top-notch. The nurses and staff were attentive, friendly, and went out of their way to ensure my comfort and well-being. They consistently checked in on me, answered all my questions, and made me feel cared for during my recovery.

From the PA system I could tell that all the nurses were spread thin and constantly being pulled in all directions. (Especially day nurse Bravo) in spite of all that, they always found the time and means to take care of me in a professional and caring way.

I was in room A163, my nurses were Shanaz, Bravo, Joyce, and Cassandra (Who was a student and I met on my last day. She showed exceptional knowledge, gentleness and clearly communicative. I wish her all the best in her future endeavours. Based on what she demonstrated that day, I am sure she will succeed.)

Overall, my experience at Credit Valley Hospital was incredibly positive, and I am so thankful to Dr. Jamal and everyone involved in my care. I will highly recommend this hospital for anyone needing medical treatment."

I arrived for my appointment, which had been confirmed just two days prior, only to find out it had been changed without any notification.

To make matters worse, the nurses were not only rude but also complained to me about how overwhelmed they were with patients. It’s incredibly unprofessional to vent frustrations to patients, especially when we’re simply trying to receive care.

The lack of organization and communication at this facility is disappointing. I hope they can improve their systems and treat patients with the respect they deserve."

She has gone above and beyond the call of duty for caring for my mother!

It is not easy being a nurse and taking care of individuals who has a chronic illness, but I pray and Thank God that Alicia was there to comfort my mother. She took care of my mother more than I could as her son, and I feel she must be recognized for this. I really hope that your hospital offers her a promotion or raise as she is an angel and should be acknowledged for her efforts in helping my mother heal at such a critical moment.

On behalf of myself, my family, and my mother we wish to acknowledge Alicia for her efforts!

I had no choice but to go to CVH emergency dept last night with back pain and right sided plank pain due to kidney stones. I arrived at 7pm to an empty ER but that was just a coverup to what was to come. I was taken quite quickly then was sent to RAZ. Here I'm thinking I will get my pain meds like I always do prior to seeing a doctor due to my history but yet when I got there it took 2hrs to just see a nurse, then due to the population of patients, a Nurse came out and said long wknd meant long wait times and it would be 5hrs from when we were 1st triaged in the ER before we saw a doctor. There were way to many people there that did'nt need to be and for us who dis need to be there, we got the short end of the stick. People wonder why patients die in the waiting room or end up going home when they really should stay and get checked out. I didn't even get my bloodwork done until 10pm and nobody asked what my pain level was, at that point it was a 8 and getting worse but I wasn't offered any pain meds, I get that there nurses but really I saw first hand they were giving pain meds to the less critical patients and me and a few others had to suffer through it. What the heck, that's not right. I was called in around 11:40 to see a doctor and I can tell u this, I think they forgot I was there, it took 2 nurse to finally say something and then a doctor showed up at 2am. He did his exam, apologized for the long wait times, he was very polite. I was then passed over to Care Centre D as RAZ closes at 11pm which was fine with me. At least there the nurses were very nice, my nurse Darla was amazing fir a student nurse, we had a good conversation and  few laughs. So after I got my pain meds finally at 3am, ct scan was done, I was finally discharged at 7:15a.with no reason but that my kidney stone was in my kidney and it wasn't the reason for my pain, I just looked at the doctor and said, this isn't the 1st time an er doctor has told me this.

Last night the other nurse gave me some water, so I thought I can ask the nurse for water. I just responded politely and got the water myself down the hallway.

A month after I had to go back to see the doctor for post-surgery check up at his clinic in the hospital. I noticed there were signs saying about harrasment/ offensive language will not be tolerated, quite many of them. My husband came later to pick me up. It was his first time there, too. He sat in front of another doctor's clinic since there were empty seats there and he couldn't find anybody to ask. The doctor came out but instead of helping him, he yelled, telling my husband to go away since it was not a waiting area. My husband just left, dissapointed knowing that sick people are not always the patients. Funny I think. Are the harrasment signs meant only for patients and visitors? If so, I think you know that is not fair.

I am not saying all the staff are rude. Many of them are so kind and helpful, but it is just dissapointing when the harrasment came from the side who put the sign up."

Have to pay $1500 out of pocket because I am a Canadian who lives abroad. The doctor made the wrong referral to the wrong specialist.

Because of this I waited a week and zero Care was given. The specialist refused to see me.

When I enquired “can you make the right referral so I can be seen?” Every single person I talked to refused to do so.

This would be common sense.
I’m very sick, I need to be seen

All that needed to be done was correct THEIR mistake and refer me to the right doctor. That’s it.

Their solution? I should Come back to the emergency room and do it all over again

Pay another $1500
Wait for 6 hours
To get the right referral

Absolutely unbelievable"

Triage nurse would ask me a question, before I could form a sentence, she would interupt me and ask the next. I have no idea how she triaged as she never gave me the opportunity to finish a sentence.

6 hours, not one person checked to see if I was alive. If I didn't approach a nurse and explain the level of pain, they couldn't care less if I lived or died. When I inquired about a doctor I was told ""doctor's rarely come to this side of the ER"".

Two hours later I spoke to a male nurse and asked who I can speak to about my situation and he turned and walked away leaving me in the hallway.

An hour after that my son approached another nurse and her response was ""we have two doctor's and they will get hear when they get here"".

He expressed that he wanted to speak to someone in authority and she gave him a piece of paper with the number of patient relations that are open Monday to Friday (we are there on Sunday).

After 6 hours, I walked out, while in the parking lot a get a call from the nurse saying if I am leaving I should have told her so she can take me off her tracker.

Dear doctor's and nurses of Credit Valley if you want the public to support your cause, try being professional and treat your patients with the respect and care Canadians deserve and you demand.

Absolutely, no shame. Complete disregard for the oath they have taken, and zero level of care for the people that rely on them for care.

Guy on my right with a cut finger walked in at the same time, was seen, treated and released an hour before I walked out. Lady on my left was there for about 35 mins, seen, treated, and released. I went in with extreme pain in the back of my head, unable to turn my neck, and difficulty swallowing and was ignored.

Third world country spending billions in marketing to convince everyone we are first world. We need to be collectively ashamed of what we have allowed 3rd rate politicians to do to this country."

All they did was take blood and check my blood pressure. They honestly led with “you might be bleeding internally” and I left when I heard “you’d have died after 5 hours”. What is it gonna take for them to start fixing their system. They don’t care about their patients. I was pretty much ignored for 12 hours. This is the healthcare we pay for in taxes.

Ms. Higgins is nothing but caring.  She really brings a bad name to Credit Valley Hospital and to the job title ""Care"" coordinator.  Our mom was hospitalized twice in less than half a year, due to terrible home care supports from the Home and Community Care Supports Services. After the second hospitalization, she was given the same type of home care supports, i.e. physio and personal support workers visits. When asked how the similar services would make a difference to my mom, Ms. Higgins turned to us and asked us for a solution.  I mean if we had a solution, we wouldn't have come to people like Jacqueline Higgins, the ""professionals"", for help. I'm really not sure if that Office is in the business of caring those who can't help themselves, or guarding the long-term care system of Ontario against those who seek help from the system. The fact that those working in that office are public servants, collecting our tax dollars everyday, is very unsettling.  As a taxpayer, I feel that my tax dollars are wasted on these people who are supposed to serve us, the taxpayers, rather than creating more stress to us.  Giving them one star is already generous to their Home and Community Care Supports Services office."

I would like to share that Harleena which is what they told me their name was when I asked was extremely rude to us. This was around 9:00am at care centre E on June 15, 2024. They individual was wearing a black hoodie, glasses, pink clip in the hair, face mask, white sneakers and pink sweatpants. The chairs were also in the way when we were carrying our friend on the wheelchair and Harleena yelled at us saying that this is not the way. Harleena moved the chair in an unsafe manner as it almost hit the patient that was on the wheelchair with us. Harleena was rude to us in front of everyone including patient and staff. The patient who was with me asked Harleena on the wait time update and Harleena was again rude to the patient. I was trying to talk to the patient but Harleena did not let me talk at all and kept interrupting me over and over again.

The washrooms were dirty as well. Many things in the facility were not where they should be which can be a slip, trip and fall hazard. This is possible violation under the OHSA policy.

Please take action and get back to me as soon as possible. I have already sent an email about this as well.

I am not sure about the spelling of the individual but I am guessing it is Harleena."

We have had to deal with significant discrimination and mental harassment, unfortunately.
We have been treated as prisoners. My son was relocated thirteen times and placed with elderly patients in just four weeks.
The nurses didn't take the old patient's diapers out of the room after changing them. For days, the room had not been sanitized and had a terrible smell.
I requested the station nurse to clean the room multiple times, but was insulted instead.
When you ask any genuine questions or display any concerns, these ill mannered and poorly trained nurses treats you with so much smugness.

The nurses at this hospital are overwhelmingly focused on harassing patients, regardless of patients age or seriousness. I witnessed a nurse physically causing physical harm to an elderly patient.
The most disgusting experience I have ever had in my life, let alone for my son.
This hospital is a nightmare to be in. They made my son feel depressed because of the hospital's toxic environment. Rather than progressing, his physical and mental condition became worse.
I guarantee you that nobody is able to aid you here. It's just a disappointment."

They said, “Can’t you read what is written outside. Only patients are allowed inside.” They told me to leave my 4 years daughter alone in the hallway and i have to wait inside to see a nurse. I refused to leave her alone because who is responsible if somebody kidnaps her. They also kicked me outside the clinic and said to wait for the nurse in the hallway.

Noted: This is also a problem with Canadian healthcare in general, not only Credit Valley. I'm grateful we still have some medical facility, at all.

My biggest pet peeve. Every time I show up...
The nurses are incredible snappy. Short tempered, and lack compassion.
I get it. It's a long shift... maybe it's 2AM.
But they are dealing vulnerable people who are struggling.
This attitude could breed anxiety and frustration.

RE: Management. Your (intake) nurses need to get a major ego check, and remember how far a smile, a gentle tone, a compassionate demeanor really goes (and get off your phone, texting in the middle of a shift around patients???).

I have heard things like  ""Soo... you came here just because of shortness of breathe??""  ""HEY, PUT on A MASK... STAND THERE!""
Excuse me? Is this appropriate, anywhere in the world?!
Seen things like, Snatching health cards, avoiding eye contact, snappy tones.
Just HOSTILE! Worse of all they are hiding behind ""NO abuse it tolerated"" signage. Hypocritical, they get a away with being snappy and rude and cannot receive real-time feedback?

Seriously. This is borderline entitled. It's their JOB to incorporate customer service. Starbucks employees do a better job of 'caring'.

Lastly, the wait times are just ridiculous. To see a generalist, the wait time makes less sense. My advice, if it's life or death, GO! If you have loved ones that can help you wait the night together, call your GP and see doctor, who isn't going to just send you home with a Tylenol.

To the nurses who have a compassionate demeanor and go above and beyond to create lasting comfort for patients, I want to thank you. This is real health care."

I was slightly relieved as this would possibly expedite the results to the ER physician.

1.5 hours after waiting in the ER, I was called along with other patients to wait at RAZ - an open atrium where just one ER physician was on site assessing multiple patients. Every seat in the waiting area was filled. A nurse called patients to assess them based on their symptoms. From there, it was just another waiting game. Few patients voluntarily left due to the lengthy amount of hours spent on waiting!

About 6.5 long hours later, I was finally called in to wait in the examination room . Had a third blood pressure check done by a nurse. Was greeted by Dr. Baimel minutes later, who was stunned as she mentioned that other patients who were registered after me were seen before me. Unsure of the cause for this (poor organization?), as I was almost planted in my seat to hear my name for nearly 6 hours (talk about patience for patients). Irrespective of the confusion, she performed an informal ""bedside"" ultrasound. The results were inconclusive, and she suggested I get a formal ultrasound (but would need to wait additional hours for testing + results). By then, it had been a total of 7.5 brutal hours into a Sunday afternoon and I did not want to stay any longer, and was thus prescribed pain medication. Although my pain subsided, I needed closure + peace of mind of what happened (especially after all the waiting). I had Dr. Baimel set the ultrasound appointment for me the following morning.

The ultrasound testing was done at the Diagnostics Imaging Centre. The receptionist there was nice and helpful. The ultrasound technician was very informative and patient with me. Also very transparent; she mentioned I was supposed to have my kidneys filled with water before testing and that the hospital instructions to not eat/drink anything 12 hours prior to the testing was incorrect. I had to have the ultrasound redone after 30 minutes of drinking water.

Fast forward - was sent to ER for new registration and assessment. Was sent back to RAZ to see an ER physician.
The wait was incomparable to the day prior; I entered an examination room within ~15 minutes.

The highlight of my visit  at CVH was being assessed by Dr. Gregory Rampersad. I generally do not praise... but I feel he took the time to review and understand my first trip to the ER. This made the assessment efficient, as I did not have to reiterate why I was there for the ""nth"" time (aha). He also acknowledged the amount of hours I had spent just on waiting and was apologetic about it. On another note, there is a common conception that doctors rush their patients out to serve others in queue (which does happen, and maybe too often!). However, I did not feel rushed to leave the room by him at any point until I was confident enough to do so on my own. Although my symptoms were mild and was feeling much better than before, he remained in the room with me and answered all my questions about the test results/diagnosis, causes, treatment and post-care. I appreciate the attentiveness, informative responses and really appreciate his level of patience. On a first impression, Dr. Rampersad seems to be an all-around + effective medical provider."

My elderly mom had covid and horrible horrible horrible nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. She could keep nothing down.. Not even light liquids to the point where even drinking water was insufferable to her. I came running to Credit Valley because of my previous experience when I fell ill. I cannot thank Credit Valley enough. We were triaged and registered within 15 - 20 minutes. It would have been less if we didnt need updates to our contact information. She was taken to the care center and was in a bed within an hour from this time. We waited around 2 hours for the doctor to see her, which by the way was totally understandable because she was constantly watched by nurses. The nurses are absolute sweethearts. It was in no way a quiet day but when you needed to speak to a nurse, they were there immediately. Even when we didn't they came and checked up on my mother every 1 hour. She was constantly taken care of. When she needed to sleep, the nurse even brought her an eye mask so she could sleep better. These may not seem a big deal to many people but it was a huge deal for me. She fell asleep almost immediately after putting on the eye mask. She was on an IV drip almost immediately after her discussion with the doctor, who, by the way checked back on my mom several times too. Within a few hours she is talking normally and resting soundly. I have nothing but good things to say about Credit Valley. Of course if you're wanting to be seen and out within an hour or two that is simply unreasonable for any ER unit but they there was no negligence in my mother's care. I am so grateful for the lovely emergency nurses that helped my Mom to come back to her normal lively self. I cannot believe the stress that nurses go through in ER but I found no nurse that wasn't willing to help out and wasn't kind. My mother hadn't slept for 7 days. Imagine my relief in hearing her snore soundly? Anyhow like I said, excellent experience. They left no stone unturned for my mother's care. Thank you thank you! You all truly represent the pride of healthcare."

After that Dr Nikhil decided that it is very dangerous for me to go home at this heat rate. After few hours he came back and told me that he will admit me in the hospital and I will have to get a pacemaker implant. After four days I got the implant at Q W hospital and was brought back to CVH.

I have been to this hospital a couple of times and both times the pace at which you are provided care is that of a snail.

The first time I went to emergency and came via ambulance. I Overheard  the ER doctor telling my nurse to take out all my IV out so I can “feel it” trying to coerce me into a blood transfusion that I had communicated I did not want. The doctor gave me  false information and said that if they bring blood downstairs for me and I don’t use it I will be wasting blood which I confirmed with another doctor and nurse is untrue as they can just put it back. I didn’t eat for 26 hours and was told every single time that there is only a couple of ppl in front of me, meanwhile I was told it would be another 8 hours to have a procedure done. I burst into tears and asked to go home. The nurse called the surgeon and they agreed to take me in twenty minutes. How convenient.
I was discharged two hours after my procedure without further incident.

The second time I went to credit valley hospital my experience with the nurses were terrible. Not only did they not answer any of the patient questions they would actively try to ignore you while you are standing at the nurses station as they are chatting about personal matters and mocking patients. So rude and unprofessional. I was asking for water multiple times and with multiple nurse. When my request fells on deaf ears I decided to ask for a vending machine where I could buy water and they insisted bc I needed an ultrasound I couldn’t have water. When the ultrasound technician came to fetch me after 4 hours of waiting he said he couldn’t take me because I didn’t have a full bladder and needed to drink water. I went back to the same nurse and asked for water and explained what happened. She responded by saying she’s not my nurse and she will get my nurse for me. 30 minutes later no nurse. I went up to her station and she was sitting there chatting and I was told that she never gave my nurse the message.

When the nurse finally arrived she stated that I have to have an IV because I was having an ultrasound shortly. I explained to her that I have already gotten water and juice and that the ultrasound technician said that would be sufficient. She stated that I am having trouble swallowing so that an IV would be better and I told her that I do not have any issues swallowing. This is after 8 hours of being in the hospital and over 16 hours with no food at 8 months pregnant.

Both times what took the longest was seeing a doctor  and not being able to get an ultrasound and blood work results in a reasonable amount of time. The other issue is the nurses. I went to several departments and It is unacceptable to be ignoring patients who have questions and making fun of patients.  Going  to a neighbouring  hospital would probably save you time and allow you to have some dignity in your most vulnerable moments."

I had a pretty traumatic labour and delivery but the doctors and nurses there never failed to keep me calm and make me feel safe.. I’m normally an extremely anxious person so this says a lot about the staff if I didn’t once have a panic attack in their care. Baby kept going into distress because he was wrapped in his cord, as soon as Dr. Myckan was the new doctor on call things moved a lot faster.. all the doctors are awesome but she was my favourite because of how sweet she was when everything was happening.. we had to do an emergency c section and she told me exactly what she was doing as she was doing it and kept reassuring me that everything was going to be okay, she made sure to calm me down when my baby’s heart rate went back up and she made sure nurses were keeping my husband updated until they were able to bring him into the operating room! I have to respect a doctor who is literally cutting me open yet still peaking over the curtain every few seconds to make sure I’m doing okay! AND she even came to check on me the next morning too! Great doctor!

I’m mainly leaving this review because I don’t understand why there are so many horrible reviews about these doctors when my experience with them was just fine! Stop scaring other women who are going to have their babies at credit valley because I was terrified for this reason and they ended up being amazing :)"

I was treated with so much respect and dignity it astounded me. Not that I have a bad idea of the hospital but during these recent tough times and everyone having such different ideas of how to manage the pandemic. I am not vaccinated nor am I intending to get it anytime soon. I do not have any issues with the idea or nor do I have any opinion of others that do take it. Due to my own issues with some health concerns I choose not to get the vaccine. I really did not want to go to the hospital because I never want to cause any issues with me not having the vaccine or do I ever want to get tested for covid. So I only go to work and back home out of respect for others. At work I am isolated from others and only do online shopping and grocery delivery. So when it became clear I was going to need to go to the hospital I was very worried. I had so much very understanding paramedics and they were so respectful of my choices and were very much the reason I let them take me. They were amazing and kept me calm and took really good care of me. I was in emergency for three days as I am not vaccinated and refused the covid test. It was difficult to find a spot for me. They did arrange a room for me and care was amazing. The nurses and doctors were so respectful and understanding of my choices and never treated me like they were angry with my choices.  I was so grateful with the care and understanding that I got from all I was in contact with at the hospital. I had several tests done and each and everyone who did the testing and the porters who took me back and forth were all amazing and so respectful.  I can not say enough good things about the hospital and staff of Credit Valley. I have been there a few times, once when I had the flesh eating disease and another time when I had my cancer surgery. Each time awesome care.  So a huge thank you to the whole hospital staff. I cannot thank you enough for all the wonderful care I received."

(since my 8 year old was hungry and hadn’t eaten the whole day for the ultrasound test) they said I had to go back to register him at the front desk and start all over again!!! Sooo disappointing!!!

I asked to move the bed closer to the wall so asked me to get off the bed (?) so I did and he tried but didn’t move so said what was evident so I told him maybe better to get the wheel breaks off before so he did it and moved the bed.
I needed the washroom so I asked him what to do with the fluids so he was lazy enough to not disconnect me nor provide a carry on holder but asked me to go holding the fluids in my hands. I found out almost impossible to use the washroom while holding the fluids as there’s no place there to hold it. Back to the room I told him the unacceptable experience and his answer was “I didn’t know”and that’s all.
Then I found out the arm patch for the AV was bloody and bleeding so showed him who said it works so is fine. I asked to talk to his supervisor who confirmed that happens and nothing wrong with that. Well as a person coming from 2 days in ER also being in the same hospital the week before I knew that happens but what other nurses in ER did right away was to remove, clean and replace it. Not in G1 until I expressed my disappointment.
I came from ER where fluids where provided all the time as per doctor’s instruction and they moved me to G1 same; however, after all the incident with the AV arm patch they haven’t connected the fluids at least until the time I’m writing this review. And the list of unacceptable incidents goes on making me very concerned about my health and safety while here in the G1 area at the Credit Valley Hospital and make them fully responsible if my health and safety is compromised."

My nurse name Teresa made the experience very bad for me and my husband. The racist comment she kept passing the time during my labour was very unprofessional on her end, the reason was we were unvaccinated.  The treated us like an alien, like we are carrying germs and going to give to her. She was protected and vaccinated, what was her problem i didn't understand,  it was me and my husband who was at risk.
She was a senior nurse, but very rude. I asked for epidural, and she made it a big deal. She said "" i wonder what will u do if the epidural was not invented.  She said gave birth to 3 kids without epidural. You cannot handle any pain at all, why u keep mourning?  why u keep making faces? The whole labour was such a bad experience just because of that one nurse who thought she is the only one who knows everything.
She was letting my husband talk on the phone to calm my other kids at home, she said she is getting distracted when he talks on the phone.
This was my 4th baby so i knew what i was doing, and what to expect. She even wanted to teach me how to sit on the bed. She kept forcing things on us.
She forced the vitamin K injection without my permission,  when i wanted to talk to the doctor 1st.
We tried to be respectful towards her as she was senior, but she was very proud of what she was doing.
The delivery doctor and other nurses were very nice.
But the labour experience was not because of her.
Never going to recommend anyone going to credit valley.
I hope they learn how to treat people equally,  its our choice either we want vaccine or not. The racism because of it was terrible because of her, since no doctor and nurses had no problem with it."

Joanne was my nurse for the initial stay, and she wasn’t that friendly. I never said I wanted to do my delivery medication free, I had just asked if it was possible to have nitrous oxide just to see if it would help me manage until the pain got unbearable which wasn’t an option. I guess she took that as me wanting to go medication free. She had taken my IV out because my contractions started without needing medication. I had asked then if I could get an epidural. She let out this huge sigh of annoyance, saying she was just about to go on break and had she known I wanted an epidural she would not have taken out my IV. I felt so bad that I told her to just go on her break then and I would manage with the pain until she was back. She said “I thought you were going to do a natural birth” or something along those lines and I was like no… I never said that I just wanted to know if the gas was an option to get me by, I never said I didn’t want any medication at all. She ended up switching with another nurse named Theresa, who helped set me up for the epidural. After I got it Theresa said to me “so why did you all of the sudden want an epidural?” in a accusatory tone. Once again making me feel bad for requesting one, as though I was a huge inconvenience to them. Needless to say I was visibly upset, my boyfriend came back into the room and noticed and from that point on Theresa seemed to be extra nice as I assume she noticed that I wasn’t happy. The night shift seemed to be over as Joanne left and Cassidy took over for my delivery. Cassidy was absolutely amazing! She was so nice and encouraging, I wish she was my nurse for the whole induction and delivery process, but I was so thankful to have her for the delivery."

I think I just had way too high of expectations as this is my first hospital stay and pregnancy ever as my experience was just 'meh'.

I loved all the doctors/obgyns that I dealt with during my pregnancy. I love Dr Cohan & Menzie in the high-risk clinic, they both monitored my condition frequently and recommended the best course of action for my early delivery. Dr Tigert is the one who delivered my daughter via emergency c-section. I gotta give it to him because I'm a big time wuss so I was freaking TF out before my c-section and he still remained calm LMFAO He even took a few minutes of his day every morning to check up on me post delivery too. He's very sweet! And all the nurses who saw my incision were surprised at how nice it was :) My favourite part of my delivery was definitely the doctors, very knowledgeable and I felt very safe with every single one that I had the pleasure of meeting!

What really made my experience 'meh' were some of the nurses post delivery. I was there for about 2 days and seen about 6 nurses and only 2 of them really checked up on me frequently and brought my pain killers on time. I'd barely see the other nurses and would have to ask for pain killers. I had hypertensive blood pressure and I was only checked for it about 3 times after delivery... I was a bit taken back with my post delivery experience as the nurses before I was induced were amazing and monitored my blood pressure every couple hours..

My daughter was also in the NICU - I am extremely grateful for all the nurses that watched over Rylee and got her strong enough to come home in just 2 weeks!!! Special shout out to Nurse Michelle, Amanda, Cheryl and Karen. They were always there when I needed help and it felt like they genuinely cared to inform/teach me anything I needed, which made me feel more confident as a first-time mom. I found Annabelle quite rude, I understand that she deals with many first-time moms but she needs to watch the tone she gives off because it can put moms down, and that's not very nice considering 'baby blues' exist.

Another thing that really bothered me about CVH is that I was always told different information depending on which nurse I'd ask.

1) The most annoying was when I was told my support person during my labour can change after my daughter arrives into the NICU, so I had my mom as my support person during labour. When the time came, another nurse told me I couldn't change to my husband so my husband didn't even get to see my daughter until after she was released from NICU. Cindee from NICU tried to help my husband come in which I am extremely grateful for, but NICU never bothered to follow up with me.

2) I was told by my discharge nurse to go to L&D the upcoming Sunday and provide them my appointment paper. I arrive there on Sunday and was told that apparently L&D call me to let me know when I come in ??

3) Dr Cohan told me that if I ever feel any symptoms, to go to L&D and tell them that I am a patient from the high-risk clinic and have pre-eclampsia and that I have high blood pressure, baby not active, etc. I get there and the nurse says that pre-eclampsia and baby activity are completely different things.. like ok??? I was literally told by an obgyn to mention my high blood pressure.

The final straw was when my bill came via mail. I requested for a private room at $300 per day, and I only stayed there for 2 days = $600 right? I got a $2,100 bill? I had to contact them to request a break down and reminded them I only stayed there for two days at $300 per day.  Luckily it was quickly resolved and I was re-sent a bill with the correct amount.

Though the doctors are AMAZING!! I don't think I would be coming back here for any future pregnancies due to my experiences post delivery."

When the doctor was ready, the paper was not yet faxed from a clinic that I went. Before that, nurses were just talking and talking when they supposed to make sure everything is ready. I have told them so many times I hadn't have a proper breakfast and I am so weak from starvation. They can't tell how much longer I should wait. And I had to wait another hour to wait. The doctor did not even have my bloodwork to tell if I am pregnant or not before taking any prescribed antibiotic. See!? Liars. In addition, I paid the ambulance fee by phone, a lady called back with angry tone, telling that I chose a wrong location. I chose credit valley hospital and she told me I was wrong. So confusing.

I.e imaging.. Staff are friendly and engaging. This hospital has very high volume throughout the day as it is only one of two hospitals in Mississauga. Overall my experience, both times at Credit Valley was rather expeditious and I left feeling better mentally then when I arrived.
All hospitals are overwhelmed right now due to several reasons one obviously being covid-19 and all the fallout from that and the impact it has had! Nurses, Doctors and SUPPORT STAFF are experiencing burnout!
Over all my experience there was quite good. You have to be prepared for wait times as there are so many ill patients that the hospital has to care for not just emerge. My advice is to go early!! The two times I went there I was there at 7:30 and 7am respectively. Both times I was through triage and registration quite quickly and then into a room. So like the old saying goes early bird gets the worm!

P.s Avoid long waits. Please, don't use emergency rooms like a walk in. Virtual care is a good option as well as walk-ins.

The doctor will be here in an hour, and sorry for the 5 hour wait but you have to come back tomorrow because we don't have a Tech here tonight. Seriously??!!!"

The care was absolutely outstanding and all nurses were very attentive. They always responded to my needs to ensure I was as comfortable as could be expected under the circumstances. They continually enforced the doctors requirements for exercises set for the allow me to be released as soon as possible.

It is modern and well organized. The wayfinding is pretty good though low tech. The staff were all very professional, courteous and efficient."

They were very efficient with my diagnosis, and took great care with my surgery. The entire staff at Credit Valley were kind and welcoming, from the front entrance staff to the nurses in post op. Nurses Andrea and Cindy on A1 Surgery were particularly amazing, and helped ease my anxiety during my stay. Thank you all! You have outdone yourselves, especially in the midst of a pandemic."

The first time I went with my wife Waited for 3hours  to meet a doctor, after  Waiting  another hour and a half to meet the  second doctor. This place is a complete joke!
The second time because I was late 10 minutes, the eco reception lady canceled my wife appointment and make another one after 3 week , and I inform her my wife is in bad situations, but she ignored me .
And she is very rough , all the staff very tough and rough .
I don’t like to continue with this hospital because they didn’t care if you live or die .
If the is zero star I will evaluate them zero"

The waiting time can be very long. The staff works quickly, but you still have to wait a long time for an appointment.
The conditions are different: you may have a completely comfortable ward, or you may find yourself in a hall where 15 patients sitting next to each other receive intravenous injections and drips, the TV is loud, noise and not a moment of peace..
It all depends on what disease you got there with and how many people are in the emergency department.
The hospital has a rather nice lobby where you can sit, have a snack, and there is a food court with fast food.
Parking near the hospital is expensive."
