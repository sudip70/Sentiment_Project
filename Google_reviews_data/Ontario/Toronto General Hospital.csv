I went there due to severe attacks that put me on the floor. I had blood in my stool, my CRP and bilirubin were elevated.

No one in the ER cared, triage nurse Tetyana P. spent less than 10 seconds listening, and noted everything I told her I have as I don't have. After waiting 8 hours to be seen, the ER doctor, Layli Sanaee, said ""oh even you have your gallbladder removed I doubt it's gonna help, you need to see psychiatry for your pain"". And I was like excuse me?? Are you a surgeon or what? My surgeon was confident enough to offer surgery because he believes it would help and you are in no position to comment on something you never experienced before. Not to mention she did literally nothing to help.

This is just ridiculous. How are ""doctors"" like her were even allowed to practice?

Date of Experience: Monday, May 27th, 2024
Purpose: Iron-IV-infusion (MONOFERRIC¬Æ) for iron deficiency anemia to increase hemoglobin count prior to right knee replacement surgery.

On Monday, May 27th, I underwent an Iron-IV-infusion at Toronto General Hospital to prepare for my upcoming right knee replacement surgery scheduled for Friday, May 31st, 2024. The infusion process began promptly at 12:30 PM. Initially, a low dosage was administered for the first 20 minutes. Shortly after, a higher dosage of 200 mg was infused into my bloodstream over the course of about an hour.

Unfortunately, I did not notice the adverse effects of the infusion until my nephew pointed out that I was scratching incessantly. This skin irritation quickly escalated, spreading to my hands, arms, thighs, upper back, and legs. The itching was unbearable, leading to a rash-like appearance with hives that were flaky, dry, and scaly. Despite taking Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), the itching persisted and made it difficult to sleep.

On the day of my surgery at Toronto Western Hospital, May 31st, 2024, I reported the symptoms of my allergic reaction to the Iron-Infusion to the nurses and the anesthesiologist. Unfortunately, my concerns were dismissed, and no additional measures were taken to alleviate my discomfort. Upon discharge, I was still suffering from intense itching, and my repeated requests for stronger medication were ignored.

In desperation, I sought help from my Family Physician, Dr. Thomas Fung. He saw me on Thursday, June 6th, during his walk-in clinic hours. Dr. Fung provided exceptional care, displaying both sympathy and empathy. He noted my condition, including multiple hives and snake-like skin, and took immediate action. Dr. Fung conducted a full CBC (complete blood count), checked my vitals (which were normal), and prescribed Prednisone (corticosteroids) to be taken orally.

Thanks to Dr. Fung‚Äôs attentive care and appropriate medication, my condition improved significantly. The itching has subsided, and I feel much better. Dr. Fung's dedication and patient-centered approach remind me that there are still physicians who prioritize patient care over financial gain. His father, who was also a physician, instilled these values, and Dr. Fung has carried on this legacy with distinction.

I am grateful for Dr. Fung and his commitment to his patients. God bless both Dr. Fung and his father for their services as doctors in Toronto, Ontario.

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ (3/5)

Pros:

Timely initiation of the Iron-IV-infusion.
Efficient walk-in clinic at Dr. Fung's office.
Cons:

Inadequate management of adverse reactions at Toronto General and Toronto Western Hospitals.
Lack of responsiveness from hospital staff regarding post-surgery complications.
This experience highlights the critical importance of compassionate care and the need for hospital staff to listen to and address patient concerns promptly."

Perhaps even worse than some hospitals I've been to in third-world countries. It is not the patients' fault if you do not have the ability and foresight to organize your workflow efficiencies well at the ER. Staffs are poorly disciplined, with zero common sense and no sense of urgency to expedite when my friend is in severe pain from a highly likely appendix rupture - I was right at the counter and they pretended like I wasn't there as they continued chatting about nonsense. The IV drip bags were not changed when it got empty - poor quality assurance. 3 different staffs came in to ask my friend the same questions about her condition, forcing her to repeat while she is in acute pain - poor communication system. We were promised to do an emergency ultrasound scan to check on her abdomen as soon as possible, but they kept dragging her for the past 7 hours, with temp meds to keep the pain down - don't you think that's a waste of resources when she could be shuttled straight to the lab for a quick scan just to make sure everything is okay?

I understand hospitals are full of psychopathic doctors and nurses, but even psychopaths know how to be tactful and  professional in their conduct towards people when they are in their most vulnerable state - giving snarky remarks and pissing half the patients off in the process is not it. At least do a better job to assure your patients kindly, and take damage control when you fked up.

Super vexed and disappointed by this jungle of a world-class hospital. It is incredulous to make someone wait when they are about to pass out already. I do not blame the staffs entirely as many are probably overworked and exhausted, but obviously the management can do better in improving their communication and workflow efficiencies to save on time, resources, and perhaps even money to pay your staffs more and hire more people!!"

We waited on a family member in surgery, who we were told initially was going to be in surgery for 6-8 hours. It stretched to 12 hours and we got absolutely zero updates from anybody. The staff working were, for the most part, incredibly incompetent and had no idea who was where. It took us an hour just to find out where she was in recovery. Neither the surgeons working on her, nor their staff could be bothered to give us any sort of an update. This has been such an incredibly stressful situation all around for our family, and this was only compounded by the absolutely abysmal bedside manner.

When I finally made it upstairs to the famous cardiology wing I was put with loud, obnoxious roommates. I got absolutely no sleep ever. Last night they told me to not eat or drink after midnight for some procedures I was to have today...they didn't have me scheduled to get anything done until 3pm, and by that time I was starving and dizzy.

Mind you there were 3 other people in the waiting room and a few others who where just there to sleep. At 7 i was brought to a different chair in the back. I was under the impression that a doctor was present to see patients - wrong. I was told they were unavailable but a second doctor would come in at 8. At 8 I asked where the second doctor was and the nurse said they were working on the other side of emerg, but another THIRD doctor would be in at noon. Now I‚Äôve been awake for 27 hours and have spent my entire night and morning at the ER with a wound gushing blood. This was the most absurd experience of my life, half the time there wasn‚Äôt a single staff member to be found and the other half of the time they were chatting and restocking supplies as if myself and a handful of other people weren‚Äôt waiting to be seen (or at least temporarily cleaned up in my case). I feel sick even thinking about how poorly run this hospital is. It would have been faster to fly to Mt Sinai in Manhattan, get fixed up, and fly back.

Keep in mind that the best times to come to the hospital are around 9:00am to 2:00pm Monday to Friday since they don't get too many patients since most people are at work/employment so it's easier for their staff to give good care to them.

While I was on the phone with my mom all they were doing was talking about Chanel bags and the death of Jerry Springer. Super unprofessional and lazy.

When you ask the nurses for information, they either actively ignore you or they look at you as if they‚Äôre annoyed to see that you have questions.

One nurse called Margarita did a great job: she was kind and responded to my condition with sympathy but only after 4 hours of waiting.

Just unbelievable, she gave me huge attitude, was super rude and made me all nervous and felt anxiety. They couldn't wait for 15 min and moved me back to my previous room, in front of crazy screamer, but because of this rush, I lost expensive devise during this sudden move.The night before, they admitted a woman (OD) who they put just beside my bed, who didn't seem sick at all, was jumping and very loudly screaming, calling all her relatives and all names she knew, disturbing people around and nurses were all around her, absolutely ignoring the needs of other patients and allowing crazy hysterical screamings and other noises of that woman. I could not relax even for a minute, started feeling very sick and was in lots of pain after surgery, it was at the 9th floor and my surgery was resection of small intestine.  After many hours of sufferings, I could not even walk and could not escape, therefore was forced to listen to crazy screams , my nurse thankfully moved me to another room where at least I could sleep, and pain medication was finally increased. Resident doctors who I saw at the morning said everything seems OK to them and if I feel good, by evening I can go home. Not sure why 70 CRP was good for them,they didn't even see my last blood test, showing 102mg, as it was done few hours later. Show me please another country where after abdominal surgery people get discharged from hospitals on the second day, without careful review of their tests, blood results and how they feeling! Nobody checked my blood with raising CRP that every day was raising higher from 50 to 70 and became 102mg and flagged as High. My chest CT scan showed new moderate pneumoperitoneum, unusual pain in shoulders was killing me. I tried, but could not find anybody to discuss what is wrong with me, while I started feeling weak and sick, so was forced to go home, as had no other option. Nobody helped me, nobody helped my daughter who is 16 to find a wheel chair and help with stuff. When I was almost home, doctor on duty finally called me and said to come back if Im feeling sick, but when I called back later, a nurse told me she knows nothing, I'm discharged and go to Emergency.

Here is a suggestion; use some of the money you get in donations to build a new emergency room, have one side non-emergency and the other side for a real emergency and in the interim, makeup pamphlets on how to educate the public on using telehealth.

I received very good care after walking in with jaundice and received quick testing which alarmingly revealed pancreatic cancer.  I was quickly given on operable diagnosis and went back for surgery after about 4 weeks, pretty good but longer than I had wanted to wait.  The preparation nurses were excellent, we knew what to expect and what to do.  Surgeon, Dr. Greig, was excellent, very lucky to get him, and 9 hour surgery went well.
The problem arose at night time.   The nursing staff was thin and four out of five nights they were busy dealing with one or more of my elderly neighbours who were confused or mentally ill and wanted to get out or know where they were which went on for hours. They were grumpy old guys who made a big fuss and wore out my sympathy with their demanding and unreasonable behaviour and attention seeking.  The other problem was the machinery going 'ping' which went off a lot and twice I experienced all night 'pings' from machines that seemed to be unresponsive.   I spent one night pressing the reset button every five minutes on my IV machine which I couldn't get anyone to change.
I lost a lot of sleep and despite willingness to pay for private or semi private room they were not available.  My care suffered too, and I felt dirty and tired.   I managed to catch some essential sleep during the day but naturally there were a lot of interruptions in a room with four patients.
Daytime nurses were generally friendly and enthusiastic and there was a nice friendly buzz much of the time around the station on our floor, despite the high mortality, which is really a credit to the staff.
The surgical staff were excellent and supportive and I was able to go home five days after surgery, almost a record.  Fortunately I am relatively young and fit, or the hospital stay may have done me a lot more damage!"

I understand that the nurses & doctors were doing the best they can, but to not give us any update at all was too frustrating. Today, my boyfriend had to come back for another procedure. He was there at 8am, but only got to be assisted at 12:05pm. This is even worse than Manila hospitals."

I have an anxiety and panic disorder, I was originally allowed a visitor but when I was placed in a cubicle the nurse told me my visitor wasn‚Äôt allowed which caused me to panic. When I was given the opportunity to speak to the doctor, he was quick to diagnose and walk off without allowing me to ask any questions. I was prescribed morphine for pain that I described as tolerable, why would I need morphine for tolerable pain? I denied the morphine.

I was in the ER for a total of 10 hours, alone. It is a given that when you go to the ER the wait will be long but I was not expecting 10 hours just to be given saline and medication to calm down my stomach. I left the ER at 3am after the nurse came back from her break and tracked down the doctor so I could finally be discharged.

When I read my charts, so much of the information was wrong. From who brought me in, to if I was allergic to anything, to the doctors ER note stating my pain level. I was barely being listened to and it was very clear on my charts.

I get working in a hospital is not easy but I stated multiple times my condition and ended up having several panic attacks alone while I was hooked up to an IV. Please do better, not everyone who comes into the ER in DT TO is some person on drugs. There are so many students down here who are alone and experiences like this can hurt us mentally long term.

Edit: 2 months since this experience and I was re-admitted into a different hospital with the same issues I came into TGH with. TGH did not give me a diagnosis nor send me anywhere. I just had a gastroscopy today for high levels of acidity. Maybe if you guys actually listened to your patients instead of trying to bandaid stuff with morphine, I would have dealt with this 2 months ago."

But I feel that I have to let people know about this. The system of the emergency room is confusing. You have to go through a few rounds until you get to see the real doctor. That means the waiting time is forever. And the worst is that they let the person whose daughter seems to be a nurse to get in front of others who are much earlier there. The daughter first squeezed his father through the blood test, then when they came inside she stopped the doctor who has called me to the room. The doctor just switched records, went to see his father... I questioned the doctor, but he just said he is doing his job and it is based on individual case. I understand if someone indeed has serious situation, they need to be taken care of first. But I don't see the person has any sign of suffering and he looks much better than people who are earlier than him. If his situation is indeed serious, the assessing nurse would have put him in front of others rather than until his daughter talked to the doctor....very disappointed"

Also, when I finally got to speak to a staff member, I expressed that I was suffering and she outright told me that I was not suffering and was already better off for being able to see someone and get test done on the same day instead of having to wait weeks for outpatient care.

Came in early morning because my husband wasn‚Äôt well and had chest pains. They triaged him and then forgot to move him in. We waited for 2 hours outside. I asked a couple times how long it was going to take. Finally, a nurse realized they made a mistake and sent him in to rapid assessment. All the people that had come after us were now waiting ahead him. When we asked why he wasn‚Äôt prioritized if the hospital realized a mistake was made, they said it was our fault for waiting and not checking, and that someone likely would have called out his name, when in fact no one did. They said just wait and if you have any issues call patient care or feel free to leave, I don‚Äôt understand why the healthcare system makes people feel bad when they are already at their lowest. So unorganized. I wish hospitals and healthcare system was supported by workers who liked what they did and weren‚Äôt overworked."

After waiting for nearly 4 hours with no nurse checking on me, I asked if I could leave and the nurse stated they had my blood work ready when NO ONE came to get my blood work. I was alone, no one to be there for me, no nurse to check in on me and was ignored the whole time I was there. Thankfully I had benadryl with me and it finally kicked in after 4 hours but could have been so much worse. I thought the city would have better care than my hometown but this was so much worse.

I went to the hospital again around August. Since I live nearby I just walk since it's about a 5 minute walk and got charged for an ambulance despite never riding or calling for one. Absolutely garbage hospital."

I was out of word to see this cos this as i said is the best hospital staff i know but that person was behaving soo bad for some reason. I never had any kind of attitude or havent said a word so i couldnt blame it on me."

Dr. Overgaard and his assistant was very caring and made me feel very comfortable before the angiogram. After the angiogram Dr. Overgaard gave me the  news that I have no choice but to go for coronary bypass surgery at the earliest and he has already talked to the surgeon Dr. Terrance Yau.....

Dr. Yau met me at short stay ward. A soft spoken simple man, very caring and explained to me the pros and cons of a coronary bypass surgery and what is the percentage of failures. Gave me paper to sign. The date of surgery was fixed for February 4th 2014. Was scared stiff but a Google search of Dr. Terrance Yau made me confident.......

Initial experience at the pre admission clinic was horrible. Women behind the counter maybe from Trinidad or Guyana with seemingly south Asian ancestry  was very rude for no valid reason other than maybe she did not like my face. The toilet was dirty  and toilet seat with urine. Once out of the pre admission clinic reception, it was comfortable and I spend about 5 hours during which lots of test where done and I was filled up with lots of information.....

The day of the surgery, 6 A.M. I found that the staff all over was very friendly and caring. I was guided through all the pre surgery process by very experienced staff. I have to admit that TGH is very huge but very well organized institution. Everyone I met knew what they are supposed to do and well trained in their job. I don't remember when I lost consciousness and I don't remember anything that happened that day. Next day I was moved to a room where I stayed for 4 days before I was discharged. Doctor Yau checked on me and the nurses in the ward was very caring. The Head nurse and Mariam , the nurse during the day was very kind and took good care of me, even if she was upset sometimes when I kept on asking her for cold water. I do have to say that the night nurse, Alysa Leung was the best nurse who took care of me in TGH. It seemed that, for Alysa, selfless service was a devotion than a profession. She went out of her way to take care of patients. Even when I woke up in the middle of the night, buzzed her and asked for ""Tea"" she did not say NO, said she will try to get tea for me. Went and came back after sometime and told me there is no tea available now, made me feel that at least she tried......

I stayed in a private room for 4.5 days. The cleaning lady never bothered to clean the room or the toilet. Third day after complaining, she came and half halfheartedly cleaned the room. TGH does have a cleaning problem.......

Barring my experience in the pre admission clinic and cleanliness issue which I can afford to ignore, I have to admit that I had a wonderful experience in TGH.
It is  four months and I am in much better shape than I was before, thanks to UHN, and the efforts of  people like Dr Terrance Yau, Mariam, Alysa and numerous other staff who took care of me during and after my surgery......."

He was an oriental doctor I'm saying this because I'm trying to remember his name he saved my life I think it was Cheung.and because of him I ended up going to a hematologist finding out I had intravascular hemolysis from a leaky heart valve which I already had surgery for but they told me I needed another surgery wow. I found this out after going to several hematologist appointments. GODBLESS YOU Dr. And dr. Demko also sorry if I'm spelling it wrong she's a hematologist. Thank you for the doctors that  actually do their job. I am extremely grateful. So I had my open heart surgery almost 5 weeks ago was a 7 hr surgery.
