She  even communicated my concerns to the doctor with much precision, she did not shrugged off my questions or dismissed any concerns. Instead, she provided clear explanations and reassurance, which made me feel grateful for her exceptional service. Thank you so much!"

Everyone was very nice to my mother and took very good care of her. Great hospital with a great reputation. Thank you."

I‚Äôm proud to say that my child was born here and the vast majority of the staff are caring and professional. There is also some room for improvement as the waiting hours in the ER are severely long. Some patients even leave without seeing the doctor due to fatigue. I sympathise with the doctors and nurses who work long hours to make up for staff shortages. I have seen more security guards than doctors at the ER.

All the nurses are extremely rude and ignore the patients!!!! My mom has very bad dementia and was ignored if we needed anything by pushing the call button..

My mom has been here admitted before and the same treatment happened on the 7th floor!!

While here another lady came to us and said she is there with her 95 year old mom and is being treated the same way !!
We left my mom at 9 pm and got back at 7:23am the next morning to find my mom so drugged up that she couldn‚Äôt even speak for a whole day!!!!!
The nurses also made my mom fall in the shower and didn‚Äôt even report it !!!

This hospital needs to be carefully monitored has the patients are not being treated properly !!!!!

We are planning to go to CP24 with all our issues!!
We have already spoken to our MPP"

Lazy, useless, loud nursing staff.  My brother was in and out of this place for months. The first week he was there, he was delirious,  fell and no one bothered to let us know ( why bother having an emergency contact number if you dont let the family know). They said he wasn't using the call bell.  After that we all took turns to stay at the hospital because the staff were unwilling to do the bare minimum. Like make sure he took his medication, ate, do basic peri care. We would barely use the call bell but when we did it would take at least 10min for someone to show up. Once or twice I would just go out to the nursing station and if I didn't encounter a scowling nurse at the reception desk, I would have staff scurry away into the back to avoid having to do their jobs. At night, there would be staff laughing and calling down the hallways for each other. When staff would finally show up to a room, many would just barge into the room, turn on the lights and not bother to introduce themselves or even say what they were there for. They'd just start poking and prodding. The first time my brother was admitted he ended up with bed sores. My sister, who is a nurse pointed it out and it was documented. But when he was being discharged,  the attending nurse insisted that it wasn't a bed sore, was just a scratch and either way it was already healed.
We had the same experience the next 2 times he was admitted on the inpatient units. He would come in for a procedure, would get blood work done, have abnormal results and was told to stay. Each time we had family stay with him through out the day and over night. The last week of his life we did not stay and he went from an inpatient, to the ICU in a coma. He was dead in a week.
Do not bring any family members who may be delirious, or have any type of cognitive impairment.  It will be a death sentence."

It's by far the worst experience I've had, with incompetent doctors and unfriendly staff. They misdiagnosed me twice, leading to severe and prolonged pain that took much longer to heal. If they'd gotten it right the first time, my recovery would have been quicker. On top of that, they seem incapable of handling anything efficiently.

Trouble breathing/shortness of breath. Things were running smoothly at first, had the initial consultation, IV administration, and X-rays done within reasonable time. However, once we were placed in the waiting area for our results, we still had not been seen by a doctor. The previous tests were done by nurses. At 5 AM we finally complained, which we don‚Äôt normally do because we understand what we sign up for when coming to the ER. We were told that the nurses that were helping us already left and were waiting for new staff and a new doctor. Mind you a doctor still hasn‚Äôt seen us yet. This was ridiculous. No one told us that our previous medical staff left, nor was the replacement doctor updated on our condition. It‚Äôs honestly appalling the service we received here. The staff doesn‚Äôt seem to care about their patients. Unlikely we‚Äôll come back.

Update: when we explained the situation to a nurse (ie. the fact that no one told us that our original nurse had left), she said she had no idea why that happened and why we weren‚Äôt told. But isn‚Äôt it their job to know these things? It‚Äôs slightly concerning that the staff of the ER don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening in their department. Further, after complaining to this nurse, she went to sit down with her friend and started laughing at us. I really didn‚Äôt see what was funny about that situation."

Maybe they should hire more actual drs for the er instead of people that pull out their licenses from a cracker jacks box as a prize. Today's experience for my sick kids hospital patient was almost as good as when my mom passed unexpectedly and the nurse who called me said ""your mom expired"""

Dr R Zarnett was my surgeon.
The surgery was a total team approach which includes surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses, physiologist etc. I had a pre- surgery interview  and a briefing on what to expect for the whole knee replacement process.

Dr Zarnett provided me with the ZB Mymobility app. It started a pre-surgery excises 30-days prior to the surgery and a 30-day post surgery excises. On top of the he booked an appointment with kinesiologist for 12 sessions which started one week after the surgery to teach me additional exercises to regain my mobility and strength.

The surgery lasted only 1hr & 15min and I was able to go home after recovery. A nerve block was provided for three day to block out the pain.
The nurse called for me every day for 3 days to check on my conditions until i removed the nerve block.

He also booked me an ice & compression machine for two week. As a result, I did not have any swelling and only used opioids for three nights for pain. Subsequently I did not need any more pain killers.

After the completion of kinesiology sessions I went back to my normal physiologist and masseur for further treatments.

At end of 6 months, I can walk/stand normal without pain and restarted my ballroom dancing slowly. Now it‚Äôs 8 months on and I am back to full ballroom dancing although my endurance is not as good as before but I can dance one routing at a time with rest in between.

Over all It has been a very pleasant experience.
Thanks to the wonderful team of Humber River Hospital knee replacement surgery team!"

The lack of care by a doctor at this place. I went there for severe abdominal pain and even though I insisted on a CT scan being done, he refused and discharged me with 2 Tylenol. He didn't even do an ultrasound or simple scope. Nothing. So this is the so called free Healthcare that I'm paying 1000s in taxes for. If I die it's because of this doctor's negligence. I don't know if it was maybe because I was black or what was the reason for the lack of care. It was just atrocious and ridiculous.
Update: So I followed my gut and went to a walk in clinic and requested more test be done. Turns out I might have pancreatitis. What's even more upsetting is that this doctor saw on the blood work that one of my liver enzymes were high, yet this man denied my request for a scan even though the blood work showed abnormalities. Now I have to redo blood work and still have a CT scan done. I'm so pissed because would it have been so damn hard to do additional test after the blood work showed him that my liver enzyme was high. Ridiculous and negligent."

Long version:

Went to emergency as I was feeling chest pains making it very hard to breathe. As soon as I checked-in they took a blood sample and ran it to make sure I wasn't having a heart attack, a nurse checked my blood pressure within 2 minutes of waiting and stared at me either counting my breaths or doing some sort of assessment.

It did take 7 hours for me to be communicated my results but honestly I can't blame them for that, all hospitals across Ontario are short staffed as we're going through a nursing shortage due to the health care cuts. However, I signed up for their online system and from the timestamps I can see that my blood work was processed very quickly and they checked to see if I had a heart attack or blood clots. Sadly they couldn't figure out my shortness of breath so sent me home with an appointment to see a cardiologist.

The day after Dr. Yao from Cardiology called me and asked me some questions, and made an appointment for me to go in for an ultrasound. Despite still being in pain I feel like the hospital treated me with respect and were as communicative as they could be. They made me wait to tell me my results but I'm sure their time is more valuable than mine, there were likely other emergencies they had to deal with while mine while painful, was not an emergency considering the tests came back clear.

Super appreciative of the staff and nurses here, they are great and efficient, me waiting the 7 hrs to be told my results likely meant someone elses life was being saved as I heard a code blue being called and after googling found out that it means there's an emergency/someone is unresponsive."

I went prepared with 0 expectations and if the service or treatment wasn't very good,  then I had no frustrations to vent about since I was mentally prepared for it.
The staff there completely blew my mind. I met Arlene at the surgical registration desk who was very busy since she was the only one there. She was very organized and did her best to help everyone who walked in.  She explained every step that I go through before and after my surgery.
I then went into another section to prep for surgery. I met with the anesthesiologist,  the paramedics whom would insert the IV, and a nurse,  they were all very friendly and caring. Lastly,  I met with Dr Sterling who was checking in  on me  to see how I was doing and to see if I had any last minute questions. Dr Sterling is the most caring,  patient, knowledgeable doctor.
My surgery was a success and I'm at home resting.  I actually don't have any pain, it's mostly discomfort.  Thank you to Dr Sterling and her team for your kindness and for making my surgery a success."

I arrived there was a long line with people waiting to be attended to, actually I passed at 3 hours, an ultrasound took 3 more hours and then the result another 3 more and in the end they sent me home and said that they did not see anything in the ultrasound.  I was still in pain and I felt very bad, apparently they don't care about this.  The doctor told me that an obstetrician would call me the next day to check on me and this Wednesday she does not call me and I continue to bleed every day, I called elsewhere and so far no one has been able to help me.  I am very worried about my baby if she is that she still exists and also about myself and my body.  It can't be possible for this to happen, if you don't have enough staff or the empathy to attend to why they treated you super badly, I don't understand why they continue this profession.  because to serve people one must be empathetic and patient, she was not the only one added that she spent more than 10 hours there and they sent them home with a tynatol and that's it."

No problem. They finally call my name to go into the doctors room at 3am - three hours later. I waited in there for 2 hours and then left at 5am WITHOUT SEEING A DOCTOR.
They only had 1 doctor working in that area. Canadas free healthcare is complete joke, combined with all the immigrants trudeau let in. People who have been living here their whole life and paying taxes can‚Äôt even see a doctor due to our liberal governments absurd policies where they actually favor immigrants and refugees over first born Canadians.

I don‚Äôt mind waiting 6 hours but they should at least communicate that instead of saying 2 hours. A joke if a hospital in a joke of a country.

It took seven days for me to receive the bill and it's due in five days.  That gives 13 days in total to pay.  If I was to mail a cheque as my payment today, it could take another week and it would surpass the due date.  Paying by credit card over the phone to the Finance Department was my safest option.

Even though the ambulance ride and the excellent care that I had received by the terrific paramedics were worth every penny, I do think that the billing due date on this invoice should have been extended, e.g. to allow three weeks to pay.  That would be fair and reasonable, in my opinion. The same policy should apply to all other invoices for persons needing ambulance rides to Humber.  Despite my grumble about this invoice, I'm still grateful to the paramedics and the staff members at this hospital.

PREVIOUSLY:  Two days ago, there was need for me to go by ambulance to the hospital.  I did NOT want to go to the closest hospital to where I live (long story) so asked the paramedics if I could be taken to Humber River Hospital instead.  Of course, it was up to the EMS Dispatcher to determine this and, happily, my wish was granted.  The two paramedics were fantastic to me in my home, during the ride to the hospital, and inside the hospital before they had to leave to rescue others.

Numerous times before, I've been in the Ambulance hallway at Humber Hospital with my elderly relatives so I knew somewhat what to expect.  Right from the efficient Intake nurse in the Ambulance hallway through to every nurse and the doctor who assessed me, everything proceeded reasonably quickly and excellently.

Thanks to everyone in the hospital team, especially the Emerg doctor, I had obtained everything that I needed to heal quicker.  I was released from Emerg and returned home by taxi cab. I'm recovering so much better as a result of getting the right prescription this time from the Emerg doctor.  Just one pill from that correct prescription has made a world of difference to my pain level.  That prescription, which hadn't been prescribed by my own medical doctor who had been treating me for this illness, worked like a miracle from me right after my taking just one pill.  I am so very grateful and happy, recovering at home and pleased that I had been allowed to be taken to this terrific hospital.

I want to thank everyone in Emerg at Humber River Hospital for all that you did for me and for all that you do every day for everyone else..  Thank you ever so much!  I went to the right hospital indeed!"

The first 2 experiences were ok, just ok but my last one was the worst.

I am pregnant and went in as I was having weird feelings in my chest and stomach.  The triage nurse at the registration desk told me that she would ensure the baby gets checked out too.

After waiting hours, the doctor comes in with a very annoyed demeanour and was  extremely rude and dismissive. They pushed hard on various areas of my stomach and said it was to check if there was something wrong with my liver even though I told him I was pregnant.  They didn‚Äôt call for an ultrasound stating that it doesn‚Äôt seem like anything is wrong and to just follow up with my family doctor if it continues. The whole time they treated me as if they didn‚Äôt know why I even wasted their time. Was in and out in 3 minutes max.

Less than 2 weeks later I had an ultrasound at an imaging centre where they noticed I had cervical issues which could have explained the pain I was feeling. Was sent to the hospital and ended up having to go under for a procedure.  If this doctor didn‚Äôt dismiss me and had ordered the ultrasound, I know I would be in a better place today.

If you don‚Äôt have to go to this hospital please don‚Äôt. This doctor was a man who appeared to be of North Asian descent maybe about 5ft9 or 10 with a Caribbean sounding accent. They didn‚Äôt introduce themselves so I couldn‚Äôt catch their name. Shame on you."

I have to specify this is for labour and delivery/triage. When I called at 3am to indicate I‚Äôm having contractions they said I should wait until my contractions are 3 minutes apart because they are over capacity, and if I go in at that point I would not be attended to. As such, I waited several hours until I was in fact 3 minutes apart, checking in at 10am. When I got there, the front desk was seemingly overwhelmed as she came off very unpleasant. She asked that I go wait in the waiting room, seeing that I am in pain. She called me after 15 minutes at which point she checked me in to triage. Once I was in the room, a nurse came to check how dilated I was and commenting that I was hopefully not dilated at all so I can get discharged due to them being so over capacity. I was 4 cm dilated and as such required to stay and be admitted. As I was waiting in triage, the pain progressively was getting more intense and more painful. After approximately two hours from when I checked in the pain had gotten unbearable and I was requesting epidural. The nurse indicated they cannot administer it in triage and they‚Äôre waiting for me to get called in so they can do so. While waiting the pain became so severe and I started bleeding, so my husband called a nurse. I think she was a head nurse. When she came, she just said that at it‚Äôs due to having my cervix checked earlier. She thought the solution to that was to go get me a pair of hospital undergarments. While she went to go do that another nurse came to apologize for the delay of receiving the epidural. While she was talking, my water broke and when she checked me I was 10 cm dilated. She yelled out to get the doctor and I was rushed into delivery room. I requested the epidural and was told it‚Äôs too late and I have to start pushing.
While delivering, and delivering in a way that was not my preferred, without epidural, the nurses are telling me to wear a mask, and to stop yelling. Just to clarify, I had confirmed previous to attending the hospital to deliver that when I am in active labor, I am not required to wear a mask and it is optional. That being said, I understand the nurses were under a lot of stress seeing that they were over capacity that day, however, I‚Äôm here to deliver and it is your job. The treatment I received was very inhumane, unprofessional and unfair.
I do have to state that this is not a reflection on Maternal and Child Care. 2 out of the three nurses that had helped me post delivery were phenomenal. Their names were Fatima and Joan. They were both very kind, genuine, patient and knowledgeable. Joan definitely has many years under her belt because she came to provide all the information necessary. She was patient kind understanding and she treated you like a friend."

Same emergency, different doctor. The doctor, Russell Uppal was talking so fast, even if English was someone's first language it would be hard to decipher. He let us go without any discharge report cause he was busy. When I found them online after a day, it has no mention of the medications he gave me.He did not even discuss the side effects of the medications or what medications he gave me, let alone saying his name.He was in my room for 5 secs, rudely shut my attendant when asked questions and simply kept saying go to your gp.I was not bothered much as I realized he simply an awful doctor and my condition was stable. but withholding medication information from the patient's report?!! After my previous appendectomy here, they also did not mention about a lymph node found during appendectomy!! I am not sure how a Canadian hospital getting away with this kind of negligence, specifically not mentioning information on patients. what if I got sick with the medications he gave me and how would another doctor or my GP treat me without knowing what I was given?!

I was in excruciating pain for more than 18 hours in this hospital emergency. Just because I have a high tolerance power, I was not crying out loud and they kept telling me to go because it is pain from acidity. To order and get an ultrasound it took 5am to 9am. Then at 11.30 am the report came (never heard even in a developing country ultrasound report takes more than 2 hours to reach). The report showed nothing!!! And I was still in pain. I was confused should I take pain killer at the point because I was always forbidden of NSAIDs because of my stomach condition and the doctor was asking for MY opinion instead of helping. I agreed for the morphin. He gave it and told me to home it is just my regular acidic pain. I looked him into the eyes this time and very firmly told him I have GI condition since I was a teenager. I know this is not the same pain. It is weirdly different and with morphin it subsidized but not going away!!! What kinda stomach acid pain does not go away with PPI inhibitors but reduced with morphin! He asked if I was afraid of perforrated ulcers!!!! No i was not, but I knew they won't treat me otherwise I said yes, please do a CT scan. He said have to wait 3/4 hours. Then after 3 or 4 hours the CT scan showed i had acute appendicitis. Appendicitis!!! It takes 30mints to diagonsis if he had done a proper physical exam!!!! The pain started at 8pm the previous night, I called 911 at 2am. And I have been in excruciating until 11am and mild pain until 4pm. This one doctor Robert Mansfield  did this for more than 8 hours. I bet if he was in duty when my CT scan came in he would still send me home without treatment. At 8pm they took me to surgery and warned me at 6pm it could burst in the mean time! I still can't believe it did not show up in ultrasound, the guys who was doing it before starting he was describing my own pain to me!! The way he was describing it knew that the kind of pain you have in ulcers. I kept telling him I have different kind of pain, it is a shooting pain! He gave me a blank look and then this. My GP my gastroenterologist all are amused at the reports that nothing including few cyst inside me showed up in ultrasound. And the doctor never touched the place where the appendicitis was cause i kept telling the pain was upperward because that was where it spread to. But is not it doctor's job to check? The surgeon came in, touched the right place and I was in extreme pain!!! It could have been done at 7am in the morning!!!
And to warn everyone, this emergency gives people opioids left and right, and send home. On my watch, this same doctor sent three home with morphine, including an elderly woman complaining stomach pain who was a past colon cancer patient! I had two surgeries in south asian country with a 6inch long incision even, never left the hospitals with morphin prescription!!! They administer it during post op for 3 to 5 days, and send home with tylenol! And you wonder why the opioid crisis exists"

The doctor explained what was the issue, how to treat it and prescribed medication.
Yes, the waiting time could have been less. However, I understand that there were a lot of people with probably not so serious issues who had to go to ER because due to Easter/Sunday there was no any other choice (walking clinics, family doctors, etc. were all closed). Also, we were notified right on the arrival that the waiting time is going to be 2 - 4 hours.
Overall, the ER department was clean, efficient and every staff member always answered any of our questions.
I've heard a lot of negative information about ERs at Toronto's hospitals in general recently but I guess that many of the people with negative experiences got unrealistic expectations."

I went back to the waiting chairs to see how far the numbers had progressed when suddenly a second and third and 4 Indian guys started to surround me. I asked them why they dont harass those guys behind me as they were waiting even longer! And as I tried to video tape this Attack against me, one of those guys tried to grab my phone out of my hand. I have to mention that I haven't slept right for days and that I was on heavy Pain medication. Luckily right then a female supervisor appeared then and asked me to follow her! I was happy to tell her that those indian Turban heads are threatening and harassing me and showed her my waiting room ticket and the Doctors Referral !

It‚Äôs been 4 days since my father was admitted. These folks have been kind, gracious with their personal time, considerate, always on their feet, caring and expert in their approach.

Cautionary note: Like any place you entrust your loved one, our own responsibility and our part is equally important. One must support the caretakers and also get to know each of them to ensure they are looking after your loved one properly and hold them accountable if their standards demonstrated fall short and compromise safety from distraction or have more than they can handle that day. It can happen with the numerous staff shifts during the week. Some are excellent and some are getting through the day.

I cannot ask for anything more. The room is comfortable, spacious and accommodates family overnight. Great planning and honouring of the elderly. We are welcome there. I am very thankful and grateful of the generosity of spirit and gentleness in the care of the elderly. 4 days at the hospital and I see how hard everyone works and how much effort is required day and night along with the constant demands made on these incredible folks. Yet they keep showing up ready to serve, ready to help make life easier, healthier and joyful. My father and I are met with smiles and genuine support although I can see how many things they must juggle at the same time to attend to everyone on the floor. Thank you to these great folks who have to lift my father a few times a day and care for his well-being. Most of us could not do this hard work that is part of the medical care. I do what I can to support them, I want to be part of the solution for my dad‚Äôs care. I appreciate these wonderful folks. They are the super heroes. It‚Äôs a tough and sometimes thankless job.

The system is definitely overextended for various reasons and these great folks are bearing the burden of it. Yes the wait times at emergency were longer than in my youth, but we wait to allow more serious cases to get the necessary attention. Time is everything when saving a life or preventing further health crises. Please support your hospital and the hard working folks who elected to take care of us, our family members and so forth. Really look closely and you will see that it takes a special kind of person to do what these folks do.

Thank you Dr. Tran, Dr. Lam, Dr. Fishbeine, Dr. Garin, Monique, Anthony, Adrian,Tanesha, Rene, Karlene, Charlene, Raul, Ron, Yasmin, Younee, Kyle, Diane, Laura, Julie, Mary, Marie, Hue, Calvin, Stephen and anyone else I missed that contributed to my fathers successful return home. Thank you.

At this point I was in tears and almost completely unable to breath. Yet that wasn‚Äôt enough to get me brought back apparently, after already being there for 5 hours straight. The staff working in the ‚Äúfast track‚Äù area were incredibly rude, condescending and unhelpful as well. I was taken to get my vitals done (again) and the nurse told me my breathing was fine and to go back and wait again, that I would be brought back soon. You can both hear and see that my breathing was NOT normal at all and that I was in pain. When I started walking back to the waiting area, a female doctor in a white coat tried shoulder checking me and instead hit my purse as she walked by.

Many reason to give this place 5 starts:

Her OB was very kind, patient and actively listening.

My daughter happens to have her water broken, so she had to stay at the hospital for monitoring. During her stay, the nurses are very friendly, helpful and professional.

My daughter stayed at the hospital for a week in a private room, it‚Äôs all covered by OHIP. The room is nice and clean with, big window, have tv and entertainment screen, and most of all the care giver also accommodated with a separate comfy bed.

My grandchild came earlier at 32 weeks 5 days and had to stay at the NICU for monitoring. During her stay, parents are welcomed to stay and getting to know their baby with 24 hours per day care of nurses and doctors. We were being reassured of our baby health and we were in the best place we could be. We also received lots of support and being shared with all information needed to support our baby as she were premature. After 2 weeks 2 days of staying in NICU, we got discharged with a perfectly healthy baby.

We couldn‚Äôt describe how grateful we are to the hospital and the team. They did an amazing job. I would recommend this hospital with any Mother to be."

When his voice was completely gone, and he was no longer able to eat any solid food- then he was diagnosed Stage 4. It was too late for treatment and over the next 40 days I watched my Dad suffer from starvation, silenced unable to speak, until his heart stopped. I blame HRH for this because they failed to acknowledge and act on the signs and symptoms they should have picked up, the red flags that we were waving. After all that, my partner is now their next victim. The psychiatric unit is disgraceful especially the acute care wing. How on earth can someone suffering mental illness have any real hope of ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù by being stuck in an empty room with nothing to do all day? Nothing except eat god awful wimpy meals, sleep with a small flat pillow and thin hospital blanket, by taking the medications they hand you, to be treated like a caged animal, your every move under surveillance including in the washroom, and somehow you‚Äôre supposed to get better? No counselling, no group therapy, no workshops, no activities, no real treatment plan in affect and this is somehow acceptable? Disturbing is what this is.

The doctors all gave wrong diagnosis, and when we requested a transfer they told us there was no room anywhere and after that day the help we got was less and less. Then when he finally got discharged we went to Mount Sinai the doctors there could not believe the stupidity at this hospital. They said there was room here for you we were expecting you and you never came. They did the tests and now we'll wait for a proper diagnosis within the week.

Masks required, yet absolutely no enforcement when a woman sat near me was taking hers off to cough violently into her hand instead.

Nurses are curt and rude to simple questions on approach.

Management needs to make staffing changes yesterday, to endure wait times are never over two hours. Longer is a crime against people's free time. Pay your people more, give better benefits. An emergency department half+ staffed by new nursing students fresh out of school is extremely telling as to the poor career conditions here.

After a long waiting time I admitted for my surgery next day. On discharge day, doctor said Surgery was failed. Need to do second time after 15 days.
As a new student to Canada I didn't know more about the surgery. She didn't explain detailed  information about the surgery. It was my first time in the hospital in Canada.
She used old technique to remove my kidney stone instead of quick Laser treatment. During stent removal surgery she placed wrong instrument in my urethra. She took whole one month to just remove my kidney stone.
She only recommended options that would financially benefit her. She needs money only."
