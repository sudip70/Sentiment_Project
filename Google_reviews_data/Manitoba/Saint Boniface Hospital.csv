The most smoothest, welcoming and great experience I have ever had.

And thank you for your unwavering, dedicated service in health care. It's people like you that we need more of in the world. You truly make a difference and I that is what we need. We should clone you both.  Thank you."

Dr Evans is so experienced and well respected by his team and it shows.

Special thanks also to the postpartum nurses as well who all taught me various aspects to caring for a newborn."

No more respect or appreciation for life.
These doctors are heartless and unskilled.who now prefer to kill their patients rather than save them.
All I can say is....if you don't make a certain amount of money per year they will purposely make you worse.
As for them being the heart specialists in Winnipeg-- well frankly we could probably do just as good following  a damn U tube tutorial. How are these people even graduating.
After many months of observation I was witness to  absolute shameful and unethical conduct by doctors, nurses and medical staff.

ICU I had this guy who man handled my body. Hurt me bad. They call it ICU.
Then Asper bldg C 4 th floor . Bed 44-2.
The ones who brought me up and left. Hell broke loose. 3 aides walked in. The leader of 3 decided she said to the other 2 , she has to get on her own. She grabbed my leg right on my stitches and threw my leg off the bed. PAIN. Than the other 2 told her not to do that. Than she told them I have to get up by myself. I call this physical and mental abuse.
No one  bother to see why my trays of came back untouched. I told this guy who came to check my heart that the food was tasteless and  cardboard tasting.
I told him I want out of here. After no food or water for a week finally I got transferred to Seven Oaks Hospital the best thing that happened to me.
I got food I could eat . I had Ginger Ale in 7 Oaks Hospital
In St. Boniface when asked the one who was in charge of the unit told me  no, ginger ale or no bottled water and no IV .
New shift came and the RN said I could have it. The RN (S) and trainee (N) saved my life. I was on last breath. My body was all shivered due to no liquid . They are why I made it. They had a heart ❤️
THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart ❤️."

""you are doing this to yourself"" """"if you don't stop this we are putting you in the waiting room"".

I came here for my client and I’m exhausted from staying up all night, the last thing I needed was someone yelling at me for no reason. This nice black nurse came and helped me find my way out & tried to calm me down then that same annoying lady came back to tell us “we were going the wrong way” 🙂 the black lady is literally a nurse that works there? she obviously knows the way out.
I understand if maybe she was confused but I had a lanyard around my neck with the company I work for & my picture was showing, she didn’t need to do all that. I don’t understand why she didn’t respectfully ask me why I’m there? I have everything I need to prove that I’m a caregiver and I have a shift there. It’s only laughable at this point :) I genuinely never will step foot in there even if it was my last choice. I miss out on shifts now because of this experience. I could go there & get paid over $100 & I reject everytime my company ask me to go because of that experience. I wish I knew that ladies name, best description- she looks like Bonnie from moms."

During those times we had good experiences and bad. After a procedure at a different institution my Mom was brought back to St.B. When she arrived with my Aunt the greeters would not allow my Aunt to stay with my Mom, which is reasonable. What was unreasonable is that the greeter then told the nurses that my Aunt had just ""left my Mom there because she didn't have time to wait"". My Mom was sedated and tried to explain the situation to no avail.
My good experiences are centered around the treatment of my Mom during her many stays in the hospital. Every nurse that met her seemed to love her. I would go to visit my Mom and nurses would greet me with ""Oh you must be so & so's daughter!"" My Mom felt very welcomed there and I felt good knowing she was being treated with dignity and respect."

He was very big and it was a difficult delivery. I was in a lot of pain, and was treated by most of the nurses like I was just being whiny and dramatic. When I asked for something for the pain (after the epidural didn't work), they dragged their feet and suggested I ""use the pain"" to try to push my baby out. After enduring many hours of pain which completely sapped me of any energy I might have had, I ended up in the OR where my baby was born using forceps. We both nearly died (baby's heart rate got dangerously low and my husband had to move me around to get it back up while the nurses chatted outside the room), and I suffered severe injuries, including nerve damage, hemorrhage, and a third degree tear. All of it could have been avoided if my pain had been taken seriously instead of being brushed off.

Following that, we struggled to get much help in our recovery room. The staff were very stingy with supplies and we were constantly having to ask for towels, diapers, etc. On more than one occasion we were promised things by the nurses (like a shower for me, a bath for my baby, and a fan to cool our 80 degree sauna of a room) who then promptly disappeared for hours only to show up to tell us their shift was over. Breaks and shift changes seemed to be top priority, well above patient care, and many nurses seemed eager to make us the next shifts's problem.

The only positive thing I can say is that the two lactation consultants we saw were very caring and helpful.

Overall, the sheer apathy shown by many of the staff was just appalling. I will never go to this hospital again if I can help it."

My daughter got there ahead of me and she was waiting in the exit taped off corridor. After I went through the entry protocol I went to her and hugged her as she started crying. I’m reassuring her that everything will be ok. About 20 feet away was the coffee shop. I said I would go get us a coffee while we wait. I ordered and was about to pay when this employee, this woman comes and tells me in a very disrespectful way that I can’t use any of the hospital services. She said she already told me and to go back in the designated area. I tried to tell her that this is the 1st time anyone talked to me and she argued with me that she did. Then when I said that she didn’t, she said “well I’m telling you now!”
She was incredibly disrespectful, I am highly respected in my professional life, my industry and my community, and to be treated this way was an insult! We were very distressed and worried about our loved one and the 2 women that are employees at this hospital just made it so much more stressful on my and my daughter. The lady from the coffee shop came and delivered our coffee to us while we sat and waited. When I took my mask down to drink the coffee she came there to “tell” to put my mask back up even when I drink my coffee.

The staff at Saint Boniface Hospital even when really busy were kind and very accommodating. When anyone came to see me they were very informative, wiling to listen and answer questions. The care I received made a very scary event so much less stressful.

Special thanks to my favorite nurse. My bloodbath nurse(they had to draw 8 or 9 vials of blood for tests using both of my arms because of a test requirement). They were very engaging and gentle as well as professional while drawing the blood. Also quite fantastic as a nurse at all other times even while doing undesirable tasks like collecting a urine sample.

Just experienced a near complete 180 here. I took someone here that just suffered an accidental blow to the head. They had a goose egg, massive headache that would not improve and could not walk without getting dizzy. Despite updating the triage staff of their worsening condition and that they lost consciousness they were not even evaluated by a doctor within approximately a 5 hour period. The really distressing part was the large amount of fully able people that had no apparent injuries that came and left while we were there including a person that was cuffed and escorted by an RCMP officer. I mean really someone that is believed to have broken the law and was walking around without problems, even went outside to smoke a cigarette came before a head injury."

meanwhile those who actually run the mental health unit at st bonface are geniuses who stick 3 people experiencing mental health crises in extremely close quarters from which they cannot escape due to being covid positive. bcuz having 10x5 feet of space that they are confined to for many days is the BEST way to help them. isn't that genius!?

clearly the people who run this unit know something that others don't. they offer lots of drugs to make folx not think or feel anything. bcuz drugs are the answer for mental health crises, not getting at the root of the crisis and trying to help them. nope. drug folx and get them back on the streets is how manitoba deals with mental health issues: genius!

so kudos to the roman catholic hospital of st boniface for knowing this is the best way to help folx experiencing mental health crises.

*** must mention that at least one nurse on the 2nd floor is extremely unprofessional and/or ignorant who doesn't realize that we, the patients, are here bcuz we are in mental health crises... she actually angrily slammed our door shut after i asked why the door was being left open by nurses if we have covid and are supposed to be in isolation. so i have to say that st boniface is not so genius to have hired her...

and i'm sorry for the sarcasm but the staff keeps triggering my cptsd. i hope st boniface knows a nurse who slams a door bcuz her ego was hurt should not be working in a mental health unit."

I kept (kindly) reminding staff of my concerns that it would rupture (as my husband was heavily drugged for pain) and they didn't listen. they just ignored me, as if I am stupid. When they did the surgery there were complications and the appendix was ruptured, meaning recovery will take longer and he has to stay at the hospital longer. We live on one income and have 3 kids under 4. The staff at the hospital doesn't give a damn about any of that. And throughout the day while waiting for surgery they kept poking at his abdomen not gently at all, and made him even more uncomfortable than he already was. I am very disappointed in the staff, mainly the doctors that they don't care about how bad the patients will get before they do anything about it. I've delivered all our babies here and always had great experiences with all staff, including doctors. So when the love of my life is suffering and I try to push things along and the doctors ignore me and wait until his situation is worse, is very disappointing."

I’ve asked 5 or 6 times for a shower as it has been over 2 days since I’ve been able to have one before being admitted to cardiac care. The nurses I ask always say they will go check and then I never hear from them again or a few said they need permission from the doctor to take off my chest leads. Give me a break, they come off when I go to the washroom and when I went down to meet a friend for an hour in the Atrium but try to have some good hygiene and be able to clean yourself, “Oooooh…very risky to take the leads off for 5 minutes. Gotta be able to monitor your heart.” Yet I am so routine that I am stuck over the weekend in this place because my procedure is not considered urgent and I am on the “routine” list for a M-F business hours procedure.
Management, you need to seriously look into this. If a prisoner asks for a shower and the police don’t provide one after 2 days of them sitting in cells, it’s often a human rights complaint and understandably so. I may go 5 days without a shower and somehow this is all in the name of making sure my heart is okay??? Give me a break!
I thought the good service and treatment I received at St. Michaels Hospital cardiac unit in Toronto was just standard procedure. It now feels like the red carpet was rolled out to me there compared to here. Maybe the provincial government should step up and provide more funding because something is seriously wrong if a fully mobile patient can’t get a simple and quick shower."

YOUR RELIGION HAS NO PLACE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HEALTH CARE!

I was assigned to go there for a cancer screening and had a doctor literally yell at me about how ""You're going to regret this!"" when she found out I was using birth control - strictly preventative birth control. I get that it's a Catholic hospital and they don't like helping people avoid unwanted pregnancies, but it was completely unrelated to why I was there.

She knew nothing at all about me except that I might have cancer, yet wasted a bunch of time (and tax payer dollars) to lecture and bully me for avoiding an unwanted pregnancy.  She also try to get me to disclose what doctor had 'allowed such a thing' and clearly wanted to get them in trouble. It was beyond unprofessional! She made it abundantly clear she was more interested in my breeding status than my long term health and survival.

I can't even imagine how horrifically she must treat any queer or trans patients who have the misfortune of meeting her. I appreciate whatever church funding this hospital has benefited from, but it is extremely unethical for any doctor to carry on the way this person did.

I have zero trust she'd do what was in a any patient's best interest treatment wise if it might impact the fertility she values more than the person's actual life.  I filed a complaint, but never heard back from anyone."

We had the unfortunate displeasure of having to have our 2nd child delivered at this hospital. For the labour we were out into a private delivery room that is in the old part of the hospital and is in desperate need of basic upgrades.

After the birth of our child they rushed us into a cramped room with three other family's. Even after requesting a private room numerous times since we had arrived. ( lack of rooms available )

There was a complete lack of communication between the nurses/front reception because every time we had inquired for a private room no one seemed to have got the memo. ( overworked staff )

When a private room did come available there were not enough staff on to clean our "" cubby "" and they would not have time for us to be moved.

If we have the option in the future we will pick a different hospital or province to deliver our future children because this is unacceptable.

The doctors wont go above and beyond. One day you will hear one thing, the next something different.
We didnt want palliative care and so they made sure we got palliative care without 'palliative care'.

They told us they wanted to take him off the vent. That he had a small window to come off the vent after 12 days and he would be better.
They took him off. Hes on an Oxygen mask with no food and his lungs have no tube to pull out the mucus from the covid like how he had on the vent.

They are waiting for him to drown.

If you take your elder to St. Boniface ICU for covid, you better make sure you've said your goodbyes. Because they will kill them here. 100%."
