"41yo suboxone patient with lung cancer. I don't mean to keep pestering this sub, but I thought I'd drop in to say good-bye. The cancer is in my heart and central cardiovascular area. It's over.",66973,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ju4mua/41yo_suboxone_patient_with_lung_cancer_i_dont/,"Hello all. I hope this update doesn't break any rules, as I suppose I do not have any questions. Mods, let me know. I did not want to just disappear from reddit. I know a number of you have been thinking about me.

I said I would post an update before I passed away and, well, here I am. I know it is fast. But things have been happening fast. I don't mean to flood this sub with my misery. I'm on some heavy duty medications. I hope this doesn't come off as rambling.

This will be my final post. The Cancer is all through both sides of my chest and above my collarbone. It's over.

I was diagnosed with Extensive Stage small cell lung cancer and given four months to live on the 6th. Well, it seems ""two weeks"" was a more accurate approximation of my time. I am not long for this world. 

As for what happened-- I wasn't slated to meet my hospice team till yesterday, Friday. I went to the ER on Thursday with chest pain. They took a lot of fluid out of my chest. The ER physician described my imaging as ""grotesque"" and immediately asked if I had considered palliation. I said I didn't see hospice till tomorrow. He said if I wanted any chance of dying at home, I needed to see them NOW, otherwise he'd have to admit me. He won't be getting any awards for bedside manner any time soon, but I greatly appreciated his candor. Several urgent phone calls later I had a palliative Nurse Practitioner in my room who went through the screening process and admitted me to their home hospice program. I went home Friday morning with a hospice kit. Met the palliative physician that evening, shortly after I posted my list of questions here.

I will not see Christmas, or Thanksgiving, or even next weekend. Every breath is work. Each one more work than the last. My team estimates that, at this rate, I will die Tuesday at the absolute latest. Probably sooner. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe tonight.

My oncologist called to personally apologize for misjudging my remaining time, but I hold him no ill will. Determining the time of death is not an exact science. I know that. I'm arranging to donate my body to science. I want them to do an autopsy and see how it got me so quickly, to help other cancer patients. The oncologist thinks the cancer may have gotten to my heart or the major central blood vessels. I didn't think small cell could move THIS fast but my oncologist says we caught it late. 

My hospice team has been wonderful. I have crossed tapered from bupenorphine-- which I discontinued Wednesday-- to methadone, with little difficulty. I have a lot of morphine and the option of hydromorphone is on the table as well if needed. I am comfortable and resting at home. 

The next stop on the train is continuous sedation, and I am very tired, so I probably will not be able to respond to anyone like I did last time. My physician says we can start a midazolam drip as soon as tonight. I will probably take him up on the offer tomorrow, if I'm still alive.

I suppose this is a good place to share where my fears around palliation come from. I used to be an aid in a nursing home, many years ago. I saw a number of unpleasant deaths due to insufficient palliation. We had a wonderful man who was prescribed a self administration pump for morphine. Problem was, he was too sick to press it, and his physician did not seem to grasp the severity of his condition. Every half hour, one of us would sneak in and press the button on his pump, which, in hindsight, was probably illegal, but what else could we do? He was very uncomfortable at the end. I tried to do basic mouth care just before he passed and he recoiled in pain. ""Have a heart"", he whispered. It broke my heart to hear this admonition from such a wonderful man.

My greatest fear was Terminal Restlessness. I saw a few patients scratch their faces and tear their fingernails out as they died, even on high doses of opioids and benzodiazepines. My palliative physician has assured me that he won't let that happen and that there is no limit to what they can give me. I feel much reassured.

I have tried to write letters to the people I've wronged. I suddenly find that I want to make amends. So many letters. I was a functioning addict for a long time. My family cut me off, rightfully so. So I have been writing a lot of letters. But I am losing strength. I will not be able to write many more letters. My CNA has transcribed one letter template for everyone. I hope it is enough. 

I also had many kind offers to transcribe letters from Redditors here on the sub. What love that you would do that for a stranger. If I was strong enough to talk on the phone, I would have taken you all up on it, but I can barely talk. Perhaps, had I not been so stunned by my diagnosis, I could have arranged this sooner. But that is in the past now.

Dad, if you somehow see this post, I know how much I hurt you and and I am sorry. I wish I could call you. I do not even know where you live and I'm not strong enough to find you. I do not ask for your love, for that is beyond my power to ask. Just your forgiveness is enough. Please Dad, forgive me. I do not want die without your forgiveness. But I will, won't I?

I beseech you all to make amends with those you begrudge. Do not go to bed angry or hold hate in your heart. You will be glad that you forgave. I wish I had done so sooner, before I ran out of time. You will run out of time, too, some day in the future. Don't leave any business unfinished, any grudge unmended.

There a nicotine patch on my arm. A reminder of one of the several self destructive habits that brought me here. My smoking habit was not had enough to set things off this quickly, but it clearly did not help. For those of you who smoke, I have but one message: stop it. Please. You think you will wait till you are ready. You will never be ready. You say you will quit tomorrow, but then tomorrow becomes today, and you are never ready today, only tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes. Today is the only day in which the decision can be made. You can only quit TODAY. Do so now. Throw your cigarettes in the trash. Do it for me. What a gift it would be that my post would free you of tobacco's golden chains.

As difficult and shocking as these last few weeks have been, I regard them as positive.

Only four weeks ago, I thought that the universe was a cold and cruel place. I experienced physical and mental abuse, chronic pain, and addiction. But my situation has forced a change of perspective. I see now that all our experiences, no matter how horrid, are temporary, and that we will all find the same rest and peace in the end. 

I do not mean to give the wrong impression to those struggling with depression. I have tried to kill myself before. The difference between then and now is vast. Death is an old friend waiting to greet you at the end of a long and well lived life. It can not be appreciated properly when sought in darkness. I know there is no magic fix for depression, but I urge you to get up, go out, and live the crazy, wonderful, irrational, beautiful life you want. If only I had done the same. What a gift is life! 

Thank you all for your love, empathy, and reassurance. For all the people who PMed me offering to help with transcribing letters, for all the kind messages and comments. You are all beautiful people. I hope you remember that. No matter what anyone else says or thinks, or even what you yourself think, you are beautiful and can only be so, because you reached out to a stranger in his moment of pain. Your hearts will always carry that little light of goodness no matter how dark your days. Carry that little light with you and forget it not. It can brighten a stranger's day. It can even save the world.

A few PMed me asking to look into their religion. In the past I would have been irritated. Now I recognize that you were concerned for my souls well being. Thank you for your compassion. I am not well versed on religion, but I have prayed, and I trust that whatever higher power may dwell above the stars will look upon my situation with infinite love and compassion. This in my heart I know.

/u/hugegrape, you wanted to make me a plushie free of charge. Your care and empathy have touched my heart. I'm sorry to say that I will not be in a position to receive it. I did not expect to go this fast. I want you to make it anyway. I want you to keep it with you and know that you will always have a part of me. I hope this brings you some comfort. You have my everlasting love and gratitude.

Wishes are usually reserved for the future. I have no future. But I find myself still wishing. 

I wish I had not worried so much about the little things. I wish I had not worried so much about the numbers in my bank account or the punch of the time clock. All that time working. I had enough money to keep a roof over my head and to invest in what few hobbies I had, yet I still kept racking up overtime. And for what? Only to find myself here. It all came to nothing in the end. I robbed myself of the most precious commodity I had, time, in exchange for green pieces of paper and little metal discs. A perverse and twisted trade. Only now do I see the truth.

I wish I had had the courage to live my life the way I wanted to. I wish I had traveled the world, fallen in love, written a novel. I wish I had had children. I have no one to whom I can pass my life lessons. No one to sit by my side, here at the end of my world. It is too late for me. But it is not too late for you. Live the life YOU want, no matter how strange it may seem to others or to society. It is your life and yours alone. Live it well.

I'm not sure where I go from here. I have been reading accounts of the afterlife from various cultures. Summerland, Elysium, Tir Na Nog. I've also taken to reading The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, though it seems I will run out of time before I can finish. What a strange feeling. I personally do not believe consciousness survives death, but I'm open to being pleasantly surprised. And if not, well, who can complain about a siesta that can't be interrupted? Regardless of what awaits me, it is nice to dream.

And that is what I will do now. I will dream. I will rest and dream of the peace to come till I dream no more. May you all one day face death with this same wonderful dream.

I do not have any friends or family to sit here with me, so I am leaving this tab open. I will read your comments and savor your reassurances, even if I do not reply. I will keep you all here with me. I feel less alone this way. I will keep you all with me as I die. You people are all I have now. I am strong but I am scared. Stay with me till I'm gone. I do not want to be alone.

Till we meet again, my beautiful friends.

Robert S

Edit: just woke up from my nap and I'm overwhelmed by the outpouring of love. I'm touched by the people throwing away their cigarettes and finding the courage to pursue the life they want. What a blessing you all are. I am reading every message I can even if I don't respond. Tears streaming down my face. Now I know I will not die alone. What a gift this sub has given me.

Edit 2: Sunday at 2:30 pm. Haven been awake much but I've read as much as I can. How I cherish your love and kindness. You helped a grumpy drug addict die with love in his heart and a smile on his face. the doc will be here at 3 to give versed. I'm tired of trying to breath. chaplain has given me last rites. Its over now my friends. I love you. Good bye",,

,,,,"Hi Robert. I've read all your posts. I am so sorry this is happening. Its shocking that it has gone so quickly. But at least now the darkness is leaving your soul and you are finding kindness and light in humanity. Im glad that you can let go knowing people, us here, are thinking about you and caring for you.

I want to tell you something about your Dad. He forgives you and he loves you. But your addictions were too much, too painful and he needed to find some peace. I know he loves you and forgives you. I am the mom of an addict. I KNOW how much he loves you. And he will find peace in your letter hearing how much wisdom has come to you now, at the end. 

Thats mostly what I want you to know. Also your life has had value. You have no idea of how you have affected the world.  Just because we can't see the positive things that have happened just because we exist, doesn't mean they aren't real. For example, I quit smoking 10 days ago.  Its been hard. I've felt like I won't make it. But reading your words, something loosened up in me, and I know this time I'm done with nicotine. For real, my promise to you. 

I hope you are strong enough to read these messages. I care about you and am thinking of you. I wish I could be sitting with you keeping you company. But in my mind I am.

Have a safe journey. I hope there is a kind of consciousness after death and that its a joyful free kind of thing. Im an atheist myself but even if I dont believe in a deity doesn't mean I think I have any clue of what goes on after this life. But as you say, siestas are nice too. 

Goodbye Robert. Sometimes people fleetingly cross our path but they stay in our hearts and minds. I think i'll think of you often. Sleep well friend. Dream the best of dreams <3",696

,,,,">I have no one to whom I can pass my life lessons. No one to sit by my side

Us. You can pass on your life lessons to us. We are sitting here by your side, virtually. Almost everything is done virtually now because of the pandemic so it seems fitting that you will have a bunch of internet strangers sitting virtually by your side, even if you can't see them, and that you don't know our names.

This is the first post of yours that I'm reading so I know nothing about you, only what you have written here. I'm tearing up. This is a beautiful piece of writing, and thank you for putting this gift out there for whomever finds it and reads it. 

It sounds like you are peace, and really, that is all we can ask for when we pass on into death/the afterlife/the other side/however you want to conceptualize it.

My sister died last summer of cancer in her mid-40s, shortly after midnight, with her husband by her side, at home. Their daughter had already gone to bed. My BIL is seriously the most wonderful person ever (no seriously), and my niece is the most amazing niece ever (no seriously). She went peacefully as well. Unfortunately my sister and I were not close so I didn't know the details like you've shared here. I can only imagine that her thoughts and experience would have a similar feel, longing, yearning, etc., if she had a chance to write it out. I can also imagine that it would not be something that she would have wanted to share with me, because again, we weren't close and there was not a lot of trust in our relationship. It is a privilege to be with someone when they are so close to dying, and that you are so willing to share this with us.

The internet can be, and is, and incredible thing (at times) and same with Reddit. There is tons of activity on Reddit all the time so your post will be seen by some people and missed by others and it's a totally random happenstance. I am so glad to happen to see your post today, on a day that I'm procrastinating and visiting Reddit, at a time where your post shows up in my feed. 

I am definitely staying with you until you're gone. You are not alone. I am here with you. We all are. Rest easy my dear friend.",696

This post has hit r/all, and it has prompted an outpouring of caring, beautiful responses, and people inspired to do what they can to have better lives for themselves. Sometimes the internet does what it's supposed to do and lets people connect, even briefly, all across the world and share something meaningful and important.

And sometimes it's ugly. I am not going to lock this post because of all of the aforementioned good, but there are some people joining in here who are the internet's dark underbelly.

,,,,"Hello Robert,

watched my brother fade for about 6 months before he went on palliative care and we lost him within a few days. It was still a shock for us.

It pierces straight to the heart to imagine that you have nobody in your life who is willing to be with you as you finish your journey on this earth, but I know that it happens. If it were possible for me to sit with you and hold your hand until it was over, I would be honored to share your last hours and keep you comfortable. You deserve comfort.

You said yourself that you would like to make amends, and I hope you take advantage of all the offers you have received to dictate letters to send on your behalf. Words are healing. You deserve healing.

Robert, we love you. I love you. You know that it is possible to reach across the world and share a feeling, we humans are incredible like that. I hope you feel it.

I can only hope you go peacefully and without pain. I’m glad you’ll be at home in a comfortable place with a good team around you. 

My great-grandmother told my mother that when she passed she’d be “waiting by the tree”. Before my mother passed she told me that’s where she’d be in the afterlife. I want to extend the invitation to you. I’ll also be there eventually and I’d be very happy to meet you if you’d like to take up the offer.

I used to believe there was nothing after death. That terrified me. I was one of the most stoic, straight-laced atheists, and as my soul mate was dying of a horrible cancer I prayed to every diety I could think of to end his suffering, knowing full well nobody was listening.

We were hundreds of miles apart and one night he was moved from hospice to intensive care, where he passed six days later. I felt him leave. I don't know how. I don't know why. I didn't know that's what it was until the next day when I got the call and realized the timing was exact. It sounds crazy as hell to tell this story. I swear on my children's lives that I felt my soul mate pass. Somehow I was with him, I felt what he felt, and the feeling was... beautiful. It was a lightness of being, a deep and profound comfort and warmth. It lasted maybe a minute and it was gone, and afterward I felt... peace. Such perfect stillness and peace.

I don't know what happens afterward but I believe I know what happens during, and there was no shame, no fear, nothing but warmth and love and Grace. I don't know how to explain it any other way.

You will receive Grace. You'll receive the Grace I truly wish life had bestowed upon you earlier.

Your dad has forgiven you, Robert. That's what parents do. He knows that your pain and struggle was about something inside yourself that you couldn't accept and though it hurt him deeply, he forgave you again and again. That's what parents do. The love is always there. It's unconditional.  

You are loved, and you are forgiven, and you will receive Grace.

I'm sobbing as I write this. I've never told anyone what I felt when my soul mate died. You're the first to know. You deserve to know that Grace, and you will. Thank you for being in this world, Robert.",39

Your story will reach other media outlets too, and people will read it and want to comfort you long after you're gone. In that way, you will never be alone.

I’m a college undergrad student, but ended up taking the year off because of COVID and health reasons. In this time, I’ve been reevaluating what it is I want to do in life. What makes me happy? To what do I feel passion for? What excites me and makes me want to reach further?

It’s scary to have a plan for several years, only for the tracks to be completely ripped off from beneath you. The anxiety of potential financial consequences hasn’t helped, either.

I know that, for someone like me, one of my keys to unlocking happiness is to worry less, and live more. Reading your post—with its beautiful language, deeply honest introspection, and important life lessons—made me cry. And helps me see what *really* matters in life, not what our socioeconomic constructs *tell* us matters in life.

You may not have had children to pass your life lessons on to. Nonetheless, go in peace knowing that you still passed down your lessons to a young adult, who desperately needed to hear your wisdom.

Thank you for sharing your story and your thoughts in this vulnerable time of yours. You said that you have no one to pass on your life lessons to, but that isn’t true. You’ve inspired me in so many ways after reading your post, as I’m sure many feel the same way. I will forever remember you & your message. I’m a smoker and I recently had to quit due to pregnancy. I’ve been counting down the days until I can smoke again. You’ve just inspired me to never pick that shit up again. I’ve already quit, the hard part is over. I’m tired of poisoning myself. I have mental illness to thank for not caring much about my life, but I’m going to try and find at least one good thing every day. I’ve saved your Reddit posts to look back on and remember you by. You’ll never be forgotten - at least not by me.

In some ways it seems so silly that I, a 35yo 6’1 350lb man covered in tattoos, am sitting on the floor of my bedroom in the dark and crying uncontrollably. My girlfriend having only known me as as a somewhat reserved person who doesn’t get too worked up, is somewhat taken aback. 

Coincidentally, I was talking with my mother this morning who wants to go and spread my father’s ashes at his favorite spot before she packs up for good and moves a few states away. He was a lifelong smoker and drinker who died 5yrs ago, less than 2 weeks from being admitted to the hospital for severe leg cramps. Long story short, I was living across the country and only made it in time to see him lucid for a couple of hours before he went to sleep and died.

Maybe it was Robert’s writing or maybe it was just happenstance that my mother chose today to share her plans. Either way, this was surprisingly difficult to read even tho the positivity of the post was clearly there in everyone’s response.

I certainly hope he found peace and felt a sense of relief before he met his end...RIP",12

I commented on your last post that I would pray for you. I currently pray for comfort in your last moments. And I find it incredible in your last moments you have given back so much to us.

This was more than just a post about you passing. You gave all of us multiple life lessons. I've been notorious to hold grudges, and I think it's time I listen to you and let them go and just offer forgiveness.

I hope you know no matter what you said in your post, your impact on this world was endless. And if there is any reassurance to you, know that hundreds of thousands if not millions will read this post and learn from you.

Rest easy Robert. Let your soul forever find peace and comfort. We will never forget you.",7

,,,,"You're probably not going to see this, given how many comments your touching post got. It's likely no one will, but it still felt right to type this.

I'm also a former addict, slightly younger than you are at 30, but just as broken these days. I've been having a rough time lately, experiencing some physical and emotional pain of my own. I let myself fall for far too long hoping that by some miracle I'll improve without putting in the least bit of effort. 

Your post hit me quite hard. At first it made me fall even harder, it seems so unfair such a seemingly beautiful soul would have to find out his life is over so abruptly. But after giving your post, and my life some thought it made me realize I'm still young, I have my health. I've been clean for a few years now and the game is not over for me yet. 

For too long I've let every stupid anger, every mild ache control my life. I will try and make use of every precious moment from now on, knowing how it can all be taken in an instant.

I hope you'll find peace. Today you managed to touch so many people, including this man on the other side of the world.",6

Robert, you may not have a child to share your life lessons with, but you shared your wisdom and insight with thousands of people across the world instead. You also gave me the spark I needed. I'm 17 and have been slacking off on studying for the past three years and I
 have failed a few classes as well. I promise you Robert, I will not waste my days on things that don't matter. Education matters to me and I promise you I will pass all of my exams this year and graduate with a grade I will be proud of. I hope your soul leaves our world (or rests forever) as peacefully as possible. You touched the hearts of so many strangers on this sub and you will never be forgotten. Not at least by me.",8

They may pretend they don't, but that's usually in service of some higher goal for you.

For instance a toddler lying. The dad might not think of anything about it, but he has to deal with the issue and not everyone expresses themselves all that clearly.

I've a drunk father and we occasionally have yelling matches. He can't admit to being wrong and never really respects my life choices and interests.

Still, sometimes, just sometimes, he apologizes, in his own way.

My point being that

I believe your father would forgive you.
And if you give out some of his info, Reddit could probably track him down pretty fast.


Amazing post. I'm confused by all the dissonance within me. It's so sad, yet true, and that brings in the love and respect.



I don't want to push any religion and it might be a bit late considering your limits at the moment, but if you have any friends who do shrooms, that could be a way to visit a heavenly realm while still in this world, in case there's just a long nap afterwards. 

It's helped a lot of terminal patients deal, but you seem to be dealing even without.

I'd send some myself but northern Europe, would prolly take too long.

[""Growing research has shown that psilocybin, the drug found in psychedelic mushrooms, significantly relieves anxiety and depression in patients with advanced cancer.""](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/world/canada-psychedelic-mushrooms-cancer-therapy-trnd/index.html)

Hope you've either done them before or still have time for one.

Maybe not with the palliative care you're receiving. Although shrooms don't seem to mind opiates and won't really add to risk factors. A bit, of course.

Just a thought.

Huh, that spawned another thought. Maybe watch some Bill Hicks for entertainment. [Bill Hicks (end of set) ""It's just a ride.""](https://youtu.be/eNEyLn1Zz_g)

Very funny, makes good points, philosophical.



You're a good person and I'll bet my left nut that your father would forgive you. Would you like to? I'm not a medical professional but I can help get the gears running to track the family should you so choose.


And don't worry about replying.

Oh man we seriously need to get brain computer interfaces working for situations like this.


Your post, its sentiments and you, will never die in the same way that we can still read the thoughts of long since gone philosophers.

Sure, maybe there's not as much of it, but the chances of it staying around now are nonzero I would say.

So metaphysically you've already immortalized yourself by selflessly and honestly sharing your story, pains and all.


[I salute you.](https://ibb.co/kMqXpQc) (Had to find my baret and hairstyle is a bit too long but I just felt like it suited this. Not an old image, just took it because I wanted to actually salute you.)



Don't know how to end a comment like this.
If there's anything I can do to help, I will.


I wish you to be at peace.

,,,,"I’m never on Reddit often, I only checked it because I noticed a notification in my DMs, then I found this on the front page. I’ve read suicide notes and seen people die, but I’ve never read a message from a man on his death bed where he thanks everyone for being with him in his final hours. Thanking thousands of strangers, being open to the afterlife, trying to write letters to amend for your wrongdoings; these are such honorable things. And while this is the first post I’ve seen from you, and probably the last, I will not forget about this. Ever. People are throwing away their cigarettes just as I threw my parent’s’ away whenever they still smoked. I didn’t think I’d be tearing up the moment I looked at Reddit, but it is worth it. Whether you’re with us or not, you are worth it. You’ve accepted the inevitable and done what you can to right your wrongs while being in this situation. I’m unsure about religion as well, but reading that you- someone who has also questioned religion, is now being open to different interpretations and researching possible outcomes, I must say that this has inspired me. I will be thinking about religion in a whole new light thanks to you, and I appreciate it. May whatever divine being- if there is one- bless you in your final moments, and may you know the amount of outpouring love that you can take with you till the end. Bless your soul, Robert. I may have never known your face, never knew who you were, or never known what was happening before this post, but, after this, I’ll never forget the imprint that you’ve placed upon my heart.

While I'm saddened that you do not have as much time as you previously thought, I am privileged to have read your words. I,  and many others, have learned more about life, more  about palliative medicine and more about death through reading your words and the words of those replying to the conversation that you opened.  Thank you for that. 

I normally do not share religious words but you have said that these words are no longer bothersome to you now, so I will share this regarding death:

“When you look a cloud… and then later the cloud is not there.
If you look deeply, you can see the cloud in the rain, and that is why it’s impossible for a cloud to die.
A cloud can become rain, or snow, or ice, but a cloud cannot become nothing.""

Like a cloud you will live on, in the hearts and minds of us here, and of those who met you.

I’m not much of a drinker, but have quit smoking over a year ago. I sat there in my car frustrated and sad and angry and confused at my life and thought I should just give into these internal pressures to “feel better”. 

I didn’t. Something came over me. I put a smile on my face, walked through the door, and pushed through the ugliness my life has handed me. 

I don’t even know how this post came to me. I’m not a member of r/AskDocs. But there you were, waiting for me. I opened and read your whole post. And as tears lined my cheeks I couldn’t help but recognize your energy was what came over me while I sat in contemplation in the car. I am very spiritual and do not deny for a second that you helped me tonight even before opening this app and reading your words.

,,,,"My Eulogy for Robert S.

In the latest moments of a dead man, we feel words. He, someone unfamiliar, was truly a stranger. His act of communicating though, finds words which lay down heavy onto us, funneling deeply, through, and across the many minds it passes. Fleeting in time, strength, and clarity, Robert still gifts us with tragedy, memory, emotion, experience, and introspection. While under pressure of known despair, he connects; he connects us. 

His words written and thoughtfully given, Robert S. is no stranger. We relate to his perspective, in empathy, in sympathy, in human experience. When searching in his words, however apparent, do not find suffering. His message in its core pleads *for* us all: as a hopeless man, he hopes. Find happiness, find hope. I will remember Robert as a man out of wishes, wishing ours to be granted. Through our own power, we can grant those wishes of ours and Robert's. We can repay his gifts given. We should give power and meaning to his words and to his life lived.

Thank you and rest in peace, Robert S. May the ending of your journey forever nourish the journeys of mine and many more.",4

Your strong and beautiful words will forever be with me. I don't want to live life knowing I could have done more. I can only imagine what their thoughts were when my friends and loved ones were going through this transition to the next stage of life after death. You have given me a picture through your words of the peace and serenity that awaits us all.

,,,,"Robert,

I don't really have religion or an intense sense of spirituality but I do certainly know when something, anything, has reached a level of profound that it shakes your existence to the core.  A brief moment in time that leaves you gasping for air as you reel in shock and try vainly to process what the hell just happened.  These moments can be beautiful or harsh but the one thing that they have in common is that they leave you forever altered.

Robert your words left me sobbing and momentarily insensate with grief; but as soon as I could breath through that stark emotional journey I was left with a sense of childlike wonder... 

I have my health!
  
I have my breath, my legs, my fingers, and my eyes!

I have everything I need to give myself the life I want.

I have been squandering my limited time in this world because of my own fear and nervousness to take that leap of faith and create/allow change.

No more! 

I promise Robert that I will not forget you and there will be endless moments for the rest of my life where I will think specifically of your intensity and timeless wisdom.  Every dream that I will touch will be filled with gratitude and will be fueled by your words.

I don't care if these thoughts of mine are lost in the masses or if they are disregarded as the overzealous ramblings of a childless achievement-less middle aged woman.

I have this experience of the profound you've given me my friend.  And I will always have that.

For the first time in my life I am happy to tell a stranger that I love you very much from the bottom of my heart!

As a young mom dealing with anxiety and strong fear of death since my toddler was born, I just hope to be as strong and dignified as you when the time will come. I hope you can write and travel as much as you want wherever you are, and that one day you will reunite with your family who love and forgave you I'm sure.

Whatever may lay ahead of you, you will not be forgotten, and both your words and wisdom will live on, as will your name, in all our memories. Whatever you may feel you have done wrong in your life, please do not worry about it, for every one of us, you included, are merely human. To err is human, and does not make you less of a good person. The opposite, you set out to make amends, which makes you an even better person than you've already been.

I wish I could do more for you than to write this post, but this at least I can do. You will be in my thoughts all the way from over here in Germany where I live, for the rest of however much time may be left for you. 

I feel happy you have made peace with yourself and with the world, this is all we can do. Enjoy your siesta, you have earned it many times over. Just like you, I do not believe in a transcendent mind, but you never know, maybe one day we will meet again despite our expectation to the contrary. 

Until then, rest well friend, do whatever you feel like doing, treat yourself to whatever you still can, and then go knowing you have made use of the time that was afforded to you by the random chances we are all subjected to to the fullest and to the best of your abilities. 

All the best to you, Robert. Ich wünsche Dir alles Gute, Robert.

Robert, I don’t know if you’ll see this post as I’m commenting rather late. I don’t have some great wisdom to share, but I want to tell you and anybody else who needs to hear this:

You are so loved. 

I’ve fought addiction to alcohol and prescription pills my entire adult life (I’m 26 and started at 18). I’ve had periods of sobriety, and I‘ve had terrible relapses. I’ve definitely caused a lot of pain to a lot of people. You mustn’t forget though that for all of the pain you may have caused, you’ve also spread kindness and goodness in this world. Most people touch far more lives than they’ll ever know. What seems like the smallest gesture of kindness could change and even save a life. I hope that brings a tiny bit of peace. 

But more than anything, know and never forget that you are so loved.",4

You’re concluding your human experience, who knows what experiences wait for you outside of this earthly realm.

Monday, Nov 16 Noon-
I put down the smokes like you asked.  I’m up to hour 28. I hate my husband and i’m cold and I keep wanting to walk to my back porch except there’s no pack and no lighter and no ashtray.  I have a tiny vape that is too small for me to break in my fist and a backup in case this one gets lost/dropped/thrown at my husbands head because he won’t do the fucking dishes.

My allergies are 50% better, and I am snide about it because there’s no way that one day without cigarettes did that.

My skin is dry and my video game is annoying, and I bet by tomorrow I’ll hate way more stuff than I do right now.

....that’s all i got, now i need to go buy moisturizer that will doubtless make me colder and might cause a divorce.

UPDATE:

Hour 51. Have not thrown vape yet.   Still cold, still want to walk out back and draw on something that isn’t there.  Reminded husband that he has literally not cleaned a toilet in 3 years and that I can’t paint because he spies on me.

No coughing yet, and that’s annoying because at least then I’d feel like i was accomplishing something.  My allergies are still better.  I’m still cold. I’m still tired.   I can’t think of anything fun to do.

My contractor asked for $60,000 by the end of the week and I don’t even care because I’m thirsty.

Smoking is like going on a ski trip where there are no lifts to get you to the top of the mountain.  The cost of doing it is that you have to drudge yourself, miserable and bored (*so fucking bored*) and uncomfortable, back to where you started. Uphill. In bad shoes.

**2nd Update Wednesday evening, Hour 80-ish.  I’ve lost count.**:

quitters flu.   there is so much snot.  i am tired. i feel less angry, but let’s not test the theory. soooooo dehydrated.

Robert.....You better be watching over me, you sunovabitch.  I can’t believe I’m doing this.

**Day After Thanksgiving**


Friday, Nov 27

I can’t believe I’m still here.
and that I think about buying a pack almost daily.  Shouldn’t I be over this already?

Pretty sure I’ve lost sight of why I quit, except for Robbie, so I better go back and read his posts again.  It’s not like I’m trying to save myself for or from anything.  I came to the realization that I wasn’t smoking because I wanted to smoke, I was smoking because I wanted to die, but it was so low key, I took the stupidest road possible.   The road that allowed me to die just a little bit.

There’s an old muslim saying, though:  “*You do not want to die.  If you think you do, go...run off a cliff and throw yourself into the sea.  You will find yourself fighting for life.  You will find yourself fighting to live*.   

*You do not want kill yourself, you want to kill something inside you.  That is different.*”

I wish robbie had understood that earlier.

Monday, December 7

Oh my god, the smells.  So many smells.
New problem...my vape was great because my juice had steeped for about 6 months, but the new stuff isn’t here yet and i think i’m at the end of my rope.

Which means Im about to be on my own.

I am hoping for an extreme flu to keep me laid up.  I hope it also destroys my sense of smell again.  But SomeBloodyHow....I’m still here.",3

My father died last year because of cancer after a long battle, also with nicotine patch on his arm. 
He was a toxic and a I don’t talk about emotions guy,with a bad childhood. 

For all this time during his last months I was hoping he would finally open up for once. 

That’s why your post hit me so hard, it’s beautiful and inspiring. 
It brought me to tears, I wish my dad had the capacity to only say 10% of all the deep stuff you just shared with us. 
Because I like your farewell letter so much from now on I will use yours when I feel down because so much has been left unsaid. 

I also picked up smoking again a couple months ago, the least I can do to pay you back a little bit is stopping that horrible habit.",3

Where the brave may live forever.

If it exists and I do not see you there, you can bet I'm going to have some strong words for the management. I'd hope you wouldn't mind doing the same for me.

Regardless, for the time remaining until I meet my own end, I hope you know that your thoughts and fears and hopes have given me a fresh outlook on what's important in my life, and what's important about death. 

I'm a Muslim, and in our texts it's written that our Prophet Muhammad said a number of times, ""Think of death often."" 

Your post has made me realize how profound that advice is. Thank you. I really hope you find rest in the rest of your time as flesh and blood. I take hope there is something far more sublime for you to experience beyond, as you greet that old friend of ours. Say hi to him for me!",3

And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds, – and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of – wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air…*

*Up, up the long, delirious burning blue
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark, or ever eagle flew –
And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.*",3

I threw away what was left of my vape pen. I'm never touching that thing again, nor will I buy more. You have my word. I'm really freaking happy to see how many people followed suit in the comments below, and above, mine.

I have your page bookmarked, before every other one. I have big dreams of traveling the world, meeting all kinds of people, pushing past my discomfort and living life to the fullest. I've been stagnating recently. This post is giving me the push I need to just say yes. To quit living this dead end life, at this dead end job, with these dead end people. To live for *me*, not for the people around me. To disregard opinions that other people may have about me and just enjoy life.

There is an old belief,
That on some solemn shore,
Beyond the sphere of grief
Dear friends shall meet once more.
Beyond the sphere of Time and Sin
And Fate's control,
Serene in changeless prime
Of body and of soul.
That creed I fain would keep
That hope I'll ne'er forgo,
Eternal be the sleep,
If not to waken so.

I've been wrakced with anxiety, fear, shame, guilt, shyness, and doubt my entire life. This won't change overnight, but your words remind me of what's important. To forgive myself. To walk bravely. To take chances. To put the past behind me and choose my own destiny. To determine for myself what to carry, and what to leave behind.

Legacies live on after we die. I don't know your story, but I will try to read your post as often as I can - daily, if possible. I will share it with any kids I might have, and I hope they will share it with theirs. For both of our sakes, I will do my best to keep this part of you alive.

But I won't. You may be losing your life, and I can't stop that. But I want you to know that you may very well have just saved mine.

I've never been more grateful for my reddit habit, as I'm scrolling while I wait for the call from my old dealer. I blocked his number when I ran the rest of my carton of cigarettes under water.

I went through some serious breakups and basically became a chain smoker. It was hard to leave the relaxation of the smoke but having loved ones besides helps. My parents live with me for now and I have been able to leave the addiction with easy. Instead I have put on some weight from good home-cooked food (that's a thing I have started working on but I believe food addiction by mom is better than smoking).

I'm thankful for your message on focussing on money too much when you had enough to enjoy your hobbies. Just as I do even though I'm university student (in my early 30s with debt). I've always wanted a racing wheel for my PlayStation and I'm building up to and even though I can afford it, I still overthink it. I'm just gonna buy it as I'll have so much fun.

I had midazolam prior to an operation a few years back to calm my nerves and it felt great. That was in pill form so for you to get an IV, then I hope it makes you feel good. It took away all my worries.

I'd love to speak to you. But if not, I hope you see this message and know that there's a Scottish woman thinking of you today. 

Also, I've never been religious but I still believe that this is all just a dream. In fact, I'm convinced of it. Upon death, I feel like that's when we actually wake up. It's what many enlightened people of all ages have pointed towards and my own intuition does too.

So when this life ends, it's a return to infinite love and consciousness.

 Far too many of my relatives have died from cancer and I know I'm personally a ticking time bomb given my own history of tumors (non malignant).  A (maternal) great Uncle and my grandmother both passed thanks to lung cancer.  My own father has pancreatic cancer currently.  I'm so thankful that the cancer research has come so far in the past few decades (my Dad will be fine; t-4 rounds of chemo!) and I'm very glad that you will help further the research on cancer by donating your body to science.  I also will pray for a miracle - at least for you to contact with your Dad before you go.  Great big stranger hugs!",3
,,,,"I don’t know that I can say what I really want to say to you. I hope you’re able to read this because I want you to know that you are in my thoughts. You have such a way with words and I hope you are comfortable. I think in the end, we will all have some regrets to some extent. But I think that’s what makes humanity morbidly beautiful in a way? We are so complex as human beings, and I hope you can take solace in the fact that you have lived your life the way you wanted to—it was just not enough time to do the rest of the things you could do. 

Your self reflection means a lot to me. I struggle with my mental health in the long term, and as it stands, I resigned from my stable job because it was taking its toll on me physically now. Much like you, I am at an em passé and I am scared too. I let things get to me and I wish they didn’t. I would like to think that it’s because of mental illness that I can’t function like everybody else. Sometimes I feel like it’s not fair that I feel so much pain in my life so often, and still have room left to feel the pain of others. What kind of cruel fate is that? At times I wanted to indulge in some unsavory things that would have led me to more self destruction, just to escape from my emotions, my thoughts, and my responsibilities. A lot of times I say I’m too weak to live. But then I read what you’ve had to say in these posts, and it makes me think that maybe I shouldnt be afraid. 

Maybe I should just leave my current career for good and see what else is out there. I am so miserable with this, and there is no way I can keep trying to make it work anymore. It seems the consensus is that “this is what it is and always will be” with my line of work, and that is so disturbing to me. 

I don’t want to live with so many regrets. If anything, I would hope that my only regrets in the end would be things like: not hugging my partner more tightly, having done too many things in life to remember or recount, having too many people who love me around and not enough time to spend one more meaningful moment with each of them, etc. 

I really wish you the best and thank you so much for sharing with us. I hope you know that you have helped me today. 

I don’t know if this helps you to know, but I know there are programs out there for those who don’t want to be alone in their last moments. I wonder if your hospice can look into that, so at the very least you have someone there for you if the hospice staff cannot.

I lost my dad three weeks ago to COVID. My eleven and half year relationship ended; it was my fault. I’ve realised that the career I’ve worked so hard in and changed my life for over the past 12 years doesn’t make a jot of difference to anyone. I’ve realised that people can be very selfish and I’m naïve for thinking otherwise.
I’m 44 and missed my chance to have children. I could feel sorry for myself but reading your post pulled me out of the pit of self despair I was willingly sliding face-first into. 

Thanks for sparing your thoughts in a time when you were probably flooded with emotion and pain. Thanks for trying to help others though you might not have received that help yourself.

Your legacy of wisdom is here on this page and that will never go away — as more people share your words the admiration and understanding will grow exponentially. You’re going to live forever and keep making a difference to many. Who can say that?

Good bye Robert and thank you

Thank you for telling your story, Robert. Your words have touched the hearts of many, and you have inspired change in us. You made us see the impermanence of life. You inspired those struggling with nicotine addiction to throw out their cigarettes today. You inspired me, a person suffering suicidal ideations to live the life *I* want, that death will be there for me in the end. That death is patient, but life is not. That it's to greet me after a long and well-lived life.

I will remember you and your words and ponder them in my heart. Although I know that you may not be here with us by the time this comment is posted, if there is some sort of god or afterlife waiting for us at the end of the tunnel, then I know that this has reached you in some way.

Tears streamed down my face as I read this letter. I am so sorry you have to go through this, especially with just us strangers. You have no idea how much of a change you have just made to my life and I will forever thank you for that. 

As a care worker (hopefully future medic), I give all of my love and energy to others to care for them, but in future I will carry your words around in my heart to give even more. Thank you for this gift. 

This has also motivated me to get help for my mental illness, to finally come out as gay despite the homophobic family, put right some wrongs, go to the doctor (I’ve been ignoring some issues) and live an authentic life that I want to and enjoy. 

Thank you. I will forever be in debt to you.

This story is the sad truth of the damage that smoking does to your body. There will never come a day to quit smoking. That time is right now, as you’re reading this.  It’s tragic that someone as young as 41 can die from smoking. Don’t let yourself become another statistic, someone who never quit smoking and is now or will be paying the price for your decision to keep smoking. You have the power to quit smoking right now. It’s the only way to stop. You must make the choice to quit smoking, just the same as the choice you made to start smoking. I realized that the only way I would stop is when it would kill me, unless I made the decision to never smoke again. I made that decision. I have not had a single cigarette since the moment I made that decision, 4+ years ago. Believe me, you really can quit smoking at the snap of the fingers. It worked for me. It could work for you too.",4

,,,,"Hi Robert. I came here from /r/popular. I haven't seen your other posts. 

But I think I'll take some time later to check them out.

If there's one unique thing I can say that hasn't been expressed by others (and I do support what has been said so far), acceptance and denial are a wave that go up and down. 

I had a friend with a terminal illness and spent a lot of time in his children's hospital just waiting around and ended up being summoned to play with bored kids. On some days, kids were okay. At other times, they weren't.

But at the very end, it all comes back to the calm. I always asked the nurses.

You may not have the wave. You might feel like the wave lasts forever, but I've learned it will pass. 

Be in the moment. It's okay to say ""I'm scared right now"" or ""I don't want this"" or to be angry, sad, etc. Say aloud to yourself that you do feel this way and it's okay. It's totally normal. 

Accept.

Then read someone else's post here. Change the tune. 

That's your crash course in behavioural therapy and radical acceptance. It's not about giving up, it's about saying ""I accept this reality"" and then move on into the present rather than the past. 

And don't dwell the hurt the old you caused. That was the old you. That person isn't one you are now. You're the one who's making amends for that guy. 

Best wishes.

,,,,"Hello, Robert.

Though I don't know you, I was very touched by what you wrote.  Thank you for taking the effort and time to share it.

I feel you are one of only a few people I could tell this to, who can relate.  I was recently diagnosed with multiple issues, that had been getting worse over time, and would have most likely cut my life short (I am around your age) in just a few years.

But I heeded the warning, and I have done what's needed to be done.  Complete lifestyle change.  And while it's only been a couple of months, the signs are looking good.

I know what it's like to get that feeling when you're told, the fear it's the end of everything.  Some choose to not heed it, some somehow find the strength to do so.  It is awful you didn't even get that choice, and my heart goes out to you.

But I know you will take some solace that some people do get given that chance, and some of them take it and do as much as they can to make it work.  That that knowledge and fear lights a fire within them and they change what needs to be changed.  Hopefully, in my case, for a long time yet.

I wish you a safe and pleasant journey to wherever you end up.  You know and value what life and time is, now.  That's the greatest lesson, and you passed that test.  Your post shows the wisdom that would have been unthinkable to you just weeks ago.  Stay relaxed, feel all your emotions, and go on until you feel you can't anymore.  As one soul to another, I love you, and I wish you peace.",2

,,,,"If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music
Would you hold it near as it were your own?
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
If your cup is full may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home

Nearly all of us. We lose sight of life. 

Ive been heartbreakingly suicidal the last year. I finally decided that I was going to go through with it recently. I tried hard to fight it, though. On thursday, after a year of separation, my husband moved out. He packed his shit, and left, at the EXACT same time that I was in a meeting with my bosses for the one and only job that I passionately loved, and was laid off.

When I was a kid and my mom first got sick, I found the Chronicles of Narnia. I'm 35 now, and, while I can see the books for what they are, I still love them. Even if the atheists are right and there's nothing after, I will always think of you as moving to to happier and better things. There's no harm in wishing, and who knows? Maybe it's actually true and we'll all be able to meet again somehow.

And I swear to you, I will pick up my novel again tomorrow. And my next character's name will be Robert.",2
,,,,"Not much touches me on this site, but this hit hard. i hope, you are able to remain comfotable throughout this. your words are so inspiring and touched me. although weve never met, i love you and i hope you find peace in your passing.",2
,,,,"I read this and it left me breathless.

You won't read this, OP, but wow. You expanded on how you did not treat people as well as you wish you would have, but even just reading this- I want to tell you that you're a deep and beautiful soul. I feel like reading this changed my life in a small way and I truly thank you for it.

Rest in Peace, my friend. You are a beautiful soul and we are all at a loss without you.",2
,,,,"You’re not alone mate. For every person that comments there are hundreds, maybe thousands, wishing you an easy passing. All the best x",2
,,,,"My dear friend, I don’t know you. But if you see this, thank you for what you wrote. You may not realize it, but this is a post I needed today. You see, I lost my dad to small cell lung cancer about 5 years ago. He had just over 9 months from diagnosis to death, and at the end he had a lot of the same fears you do, but he couldn’t verbalize them due to a stroke. He was only 62. Sadly, in August of this year we found out my mom also has lung cancer. Thankfully it’s not small cell, but it did spread to her brain and her kidneys. She did not react well to the first chemo, and I believe will not be continuing any treatment. She is 62, and today we started decorating for what will probably be her last Christmas. She is scared, but very weak and I don’t know how long she will last. 

I am with you. We are all with you. I hope you go peacefully and without pain. When you get to heaven, look for a tattooed, bearded guy. His name is Ron. That’s my dad. Tell him you know his kid. My heart is with you. Godspeed, Robert.",2

Between your post, and a friend's recounting of her serious recent attempt, I'm finding myself that much closer to living my life out of the darkness. You're right, meeting death in darkness is very different. Next week I start neurofeedback, a type of  therapy to dramatically help the way my brain responds to life. Thank you for giving me more reason to heal.       
       
Wishing you a gentle passing, thank you for using your limited time to give light to others. Your light will pass through all of us reading your post, and onto our loved ones.",2

,,,,"I know this will most likely be lost in the thousands of honestly better-made comments, but I'd figured out that I owe you one for posting this on reddit. Reading your post made me realize just how much I have been taking my time for granted. For a bit of context, I am currently a high school student who is aiming to someday become a medical doctor as it combines two things I love: Biology and helping others. Unfortunately however, my family tends to come from a lower-socio economic class which complicates getting the finances needed for university, and so getting the highest marks in pursuit of scholarships have always been THE top priority for me. My obsession with marks would often get to a comical point, where I would verbally 'fight' my teachers for the purposes of increasing my marks for about 1%. However, after reading your post I felt as if whatever I have been doing was pointless. All this time that I have spent creating discord between me and my teachers and parents could have been spent much more wisely, and now I realize what a valuable resource time is. I still have some soul-searching to do, but I can assure you that I will try my best to carry out all your wishes that you have not been able to do. While you may not have any children, your legacy will continue on with the lives of all the people you have touched and inspired.

Sacred thresholds on our journey.
Birth and death are a game of hide-and-seek.

,,,,"Robert,

I know you have a lot of comments so, I will keep mine short. Thank you for sharing your story here. I am at a loss of words. Your bravery is paramount and I wish you a peaceful rest. 

I’m a 25 year old man who is a diagnosed hypochondriac. I am paralyzed by my fear of death... I think of my demise most moments of most days. I know it is just irrational anxiety, but I cannot control it. It’s who I am and I live with it every day.

Your story has helped me. Hearing your journey that lead to tonight... your acceptance of death... it’s made me hopeful that maybe one day I can be as brave as you. I spend so much time fearing death, I’m not allowing myself to live. That’s the biggest disservice I can do to myself and it’s shameful. I know it’s not my fault, but it is my responsibility to do my best to fix it.

Robert, you inspire me with your bravery. I envy it. When your time comes, Rest In Peace. Thank you.

- Kevin",2
,,,,"I'm sorry. My grandmother passed away the same way with small cell lung cancer. She smoked from a teen until her 50s, it killed her 20 years later. She was diagnosed on her 75th birthday and was dead 3 months later. There was no chance to treat it. 

I'm not going to say she went peacefully. I hope anyone who currently smokes reads this and changes their habits. In the last days my grandma would wake up, covered in blood she had coughed up in her sleep. Her sister would take her to get cleaned up and my grandma would be so confused saying, ""is that blood? Who's blood is that? Is everyone okay?"" She was too delirious to realize she had coughed and spat that blood out all over the front of her nightgown. 

Eventually she just couldn't breathe, fluids had built up in her chest cavity, a nurse asked her if she wanted to be resuscitated as she was suffocating. My grandma nodded yes, despite previously signing a DNR, she ""survived"", but she had a heart attack from the fluid putting pressure on her heart. A day later my family pulled the plug. I did not go to say goodbye. This last traumatic part happened the night I turned in a final paper and was planning to drive to see her the next day but she was already in a coma. I decided not to see her like that. My last memory was kissing her on her head in the kitchen and her telling me she was always closer to me and my brothers than she was to the rest of my cousins, who lived in town with her. I felt honored but angry because my cousins had to be pretty shitty for my grandma to say anything negative like that.",2
,,,,"Thankyou Robert, you’ve put a lot of things in perspective for me, your life lessons and words have helped more than you can imagine.   

Today will be day 6 of no cigarettes for me, I was toying with the idea of just having one or two next week. Know that because of you I won’t.

If there is rebirth after death, I hope you're reborn in a way to give you a second chance at everything you've wanted.",2
,,,,"Hey. I just want to say that I love you. You are not going to pass alone. 
You keep saying that you feel as though you’ve given nothing, but if you can, reading these responses might be a great comfort. There are many doctors, nurses, and even family of people in similar situations who now know a bit more about what they’re thinking. And that’s not nothing.

I have a memory orchard. I first went there with my grandfather, and after he passed away, I donated an orange tree in his honor. I’ve since done it with everyone I care about. I promise that you will have a tree there, my friend. And anyone who is hungry or in need can come by and get some healthy fresh fruit for free. 

We care about you man ❤️",2

If you do get to this comment, for what it’s worth, I wanted you to know your words have not gone unheard.  I have taken every word you’ve written to heart.  I’ve saved this post to remind me to let the little things go.  

I hope you can take even a little comfort in knowing you’ve made one more person try their damned hardest at not being a shitty human being.  

I don’t know what it is but Your words were the paradigm shift I needed to kick me out of my depression.  

Thank you for reminding me of what is important in life.  Thank you for giving me peace.

I don’t even know you, I’ve never even heard of this subreddit before. I’m even risking not working for a solid 40 minutes now because I dared Not stop reading.

I am going to pursue the life that I desire. I may be stuck in quarantine for another 6 months, but that’s more time than you have. And I will not waste it.

I am going to start eating healthy every day. I am going to start exercising every day, no matter how little, for if I increase my exercising every day, by the time 6 months from now comes, I will be in incredible shape.

Thank you for this post. So raw, so amazing. I am going to live knowing that I am living partly for you. 

I will teach myself Qigon Moving-Meditation, I will teach myself basic Tai Chi, I will teach myself basic Kung Fu, and when the time is Right, I will be taking a Trip to China some day in the future, so that I may spend 6 months to a year of my life learning how to be a Calmer, Better person that I am even now.

I am of any mentionable status. I am 23/F. I do not suffer from any conditions other than mental health issues. 

I have already made so many mistakes in my life. I have done people wrong. I have lived a life I would not be proud to share with others. I live in debt. I have not had much hope for my future. I have often boasted that I don’t care when death comes to greet me and that the sooner it happens, the better. 

This post has me sobbing on my balcony, wishing I could’ve seen any sort of light before this moment. I do not believe in any God, but I truly hope that a spirit of someone so strikingly intelligent and of pure heart will live on. 

I do not know you, Robert. I will never have known the pleasure of knowing you. I do know, that even in your end times, you have brought extreme clarity and sincerity. I wish that I could have met someone like you in the flesh in my lifetime because you are the deepest experience I have ever known. I wish that life would have given you everything you ever wanted. I am beyond words expression. You have touched me, and many others. 

I threw 5 packs of cigs (just paper and tobacco, threw all filters and packages into recycling) off of my balcony tonight after reading this post. I called someone who offered me an honest job back after this and I start Tuesday. I never intend on picking up another cigarette or tobacco product as long as I live. 

I will go inside to my bf and my cat and I will hold them both as closely as I possibly can. 

I know this probably offers no solace to you. I can only imagine the pain you’re going through, physical, emotional, and spiritual.

I will never forget you. Thank you for giving me this gift and thank you for your time on this planet.",2

,,,,"Hey Robert,

This is the first post of yours that I have read. As a few others on here have also mentioned, I usually just lurk around a handful of my favorite subreddit and favorite/upvote posts that I enjoy. But today, I decided to browse the popular posts section, for one reason or another. That's when I came upon yours.

It's been several hours since you wrote this post, but I wanted you to know that I read every word. And, there wasn't one point where I thought of backing out of this post and moving on to something else. I just wanted to write to you and tell you that your words had immense weight and impact on me. A stranger.

I'm in my 30s, so slightly younger than you are. And I've always thought that I should do something with my life. But it always seems that procrastination would rule over any hopes and dreams that I could achieve or accomplish. Not anymore. I'll always remember what you wrote, and I will try my best to be better both for myself and everyone else around me. 

I want you to know that I'm truly touched by your words. The lessons and advice you give out freely to all of us. Your soul shines brightly, and I feel lucky to have been here and be a part of this.

I hope you know that you've helped me realize that time is not infinite. Forgiveness should be given more often. And hate in one's heart is nothing but poison.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us. From one stranger to another, know that I and all of us here are with you. And we will remain with you.

Thank you. 

Fair winds and following seas, Robert.",2

I am praying that your transition from this life into what follows is peaceful and that your eternal rest is wonderful.  I’m holding your hand from afar. 

Robert, a few weeks ago I tried to commit suicide.  Someone caught me and life since then has been a mess of new treatments and people at my side 24/7 because they are afraid of leaving me alone. Thank you for your words on life and death. They make me want to keep going and going and going, at least for now.  Thank you for giving me at least a few more days. From the looks of it, I’m not the only one to whose life you have added days. To all of you vowing to quit smoking, I’m going to pray for you too.

I'd also like to offer you a prayer we Catholics say when a person is in their final moments of life:  ""Saints of God, come to Roberts aid.  Come to meet him Holy Angels of the Lord.  Receive his soul and present him to God.  May the Spirit of Peace, the Spirit of Love descend upon Robert and be his companion.""",2

I don’t know where you stand spiritually, but I just wanted to remind you that God loves you. He is just a prayer away. He has promised to be : “near to the brokenhearted” and to “save those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18). We were never meant to carry the world’s burdens alone; pray to Him and cast your anxiety onto Him. Jesus died on the cross to pay for our sins and to reconcile us to God. If we accept/believe this, we are promised eternal life in God’s peaceful presence. It’s not too late.

I often worry about how I will survive in this world, how much money is in the bank, and have no hobbies. But you have given me perspective on what is truly important. I have always had anxieties on what happens after this life. But reading your post gives me the courage to live my life a little more no matter what happens. I wish you peace during this time. Thank you for teaching me a lesson I hope to never forget.",2

I came across your post. And with tears down my face I say that your words are healing and I promise you I’ll continue to fight and not merely exist but live and thrive. I wish I could have met you, sounds like you lived a life that is similar to my own. Goodnight kind stranger, despite it all I always thought this life was the hard one, that our souls are eternal and death is not but a rebirth...I hope your new journey is full of light and happiness and love. In my mind and in my heart, I’m there sitting by you holding your hand, you are not alone...",2
,,,,"Unfortunately, I fear death and have always feared death. I fear death so much that a darker(?), braver(?), more cowardice(?) part of me nags at me to just get it over with, like ripping off a band-aid. Despite the regular meditation and the religous studies classes I’ve taken, or books I’ve read; the only “comfort” I can provide is that scientifically, you are made of energy and matter. Science shows that energy and matter never dissipates but merely transforms. So no matter what, the energy/matter that is you, will always be around. Your passing is not an end, it is a rebirth and an evolution. You will forever live on and have the opportunity to effect more in this universe with your dissolution, many more so, than you ever would have been able to with this ephemeral and often painful existence. 

Reading your post, I can tell there is a lot of hurt and regret residing in your heart... and I’m sorry life has led you through those paths. Life would seemingly be a grand parade, if only there was no pain and heartache... and for fucks sake I wish there was less pain and heartache in this world; but without darkness, there is no light and I can sense, that what ever might have led you astray in the past, has brought you to a place looking for forgiveness and positivity. To me, this is what matters most. This is the true execution of repenting, not because you are afraid of hell but because you truly wish to be a more positive influence in the universe. From an energy stand point, I think this means a lot. You are taking, not even the first steps but the preparation before hand, to make sure the darkness you experienced can provide a guiding light for those that come subsequently in this life and that your upcoming journey is rooted in love. Which really, is what this world needs the most of, love and empathy.

I don’t know, hopefully this helps... if not, I 100% understand. I’m not truly sure if it would’ve helped me if I was in your place. Do believe that it comes from the heart and that I wish you the best in the days to come. If there is one thing that has mildly helped me in my search to overcome the looming clutches of death. Director Kevin Smith of Clerks fame almost died of a heart attack a few year back, like me, he has expressed fear in death regularly. On the operating table he describes a feeling that took over his consciousness, he states that being close to death felt like a complete release of worry and responsibility, he says that the allure of death was a sense of complete blissful freedom a freedom that could never be experienced on this mortal coil, a freedom he would have gladly embraced if he didn’t have a wife and daughter he need to care for.

That being said, I know I’m an internet stranger and I know you have several comments to read and possibly respond to BUT if you would like and you have the strength and let’s be honest, trust. Provide me some info on yourself and your father/family and I’ll see if I can do some internet sleuthing to find him and let him know your dying wish was for forgiveness. I don’t think love will be an issue. He’s your father and no matter how slighted and hurt, there will always be love deep down inside

Peace and Strength be with you",2
,,,,"One of the most amazing things about humans is our ability to connect — we're all people with vastly different life experiences from across the globe, yet here we are, connected by your words, by *you.* We're connected *to* you. *You're not alone.* Even though we are not with you physically, you are present in all of our minds; thousands and thousands of people across the globe, thinking of you, touched by your words.

To add to the many, many others, you have passed on your lessons. We tend to underestimate the power of words, despite the key role they've played in our advancement as a species. Words are powerful. I am not the same person I was prior to reading this. I'll remember this. I promise.

In regards to what you've described of your past: *You've done your best with what you've had*. We are all a product of many factors that are beyond our control and the behaviours and thoughts we develop and the actions we take are the response. It doesn't make the hurt we may have caused to others—and *ourselves*—any less, but we can't undo that. We can only try to understand the reasons why we did those things, offer compassion to those parts of ourselves and try to do good. This post has done good to *thousands*.

We're here and we're with you, right till the end. We may never know when you leave us, but know that in your heart, are with you. 

Too often in my life, I find it easier to stay home. Yes I have a bunch of medical problems, and find time to fill my day; but that's not living is it? I'm still plenty young, but a day wasted is a day wasted. Thank you for your words of encouragement. I wish you all the best, in this life and the next.

I only hope at this point that you remain pain-free and peaceful until the end.

I do not ask for your love, for that  is beyond my power to ask. Just your forgiveness is enough. Please Dad,  forgive me. I do not want die without your forgiveness. But I will, won't I? 

I am not your father, but I am *a* father. 

In your final moments know that his love is not out of reach. Love, once given, cannot be banished from the heart that received it.

I don't know what needs to be forgiven but I can say that, in this moment, it doesn't matter. A child that seeks forgiveness, is a child *worthy* of forgiveness. 

**Robert, you are worthy of his forgiveness... His love never left you.**

Dear Robert,

Thank you for allowing us to be with you in times like these. I am an ICU nurse and I am only beginning to get the exposure of our end of life care/palliative care patients. I will continue use your strength to keep spreading love, compassion and positivity to all those souls I come across. 

Rest peacefully.

I would like to share with you my favourite lyrics by Jewel, ‘Hands’

‘ If I could tell the world just one thing
It would be that we're all ok
And not to worry because worry is wasteful
And useless in times like these
I will not be made useless
I won't be idled with despair
I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

My hands are small, I know,
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

Poverty stole your golden shoes
But it didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But i knew it wasn't ever after
We will fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

My hands are small, I know,
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

In the end only kindness matters
In the end only kindness matters’",2
,,,,"I know this will probably get buried and you will never see it. But just in case you do, I want to say thank you for sharing your thoughts and the life lessons you have accumulated through your stay here on this earth. You motivated me to do something about the probably most destructive habit I have and stop smoking. I threw away about 110 empty packs I have been collecting for the past few months, which is maybe about half of all the packs I have gone through for this time alone. I know you said that we can only start this today, but I made this the day when I say my goodbyes to smoking, as it was something I loved doing and complemented my daily life. I cleaned everything from cigarette-related stuff and at the end of this day I will give my remaining tobacco and cigarettes to my friends who smoke. 
I also wanted to say that even though we have never met or even heard of each other I will be with you and think about you during the rest of your stay here with us. Perhaps we will meet sometime!",2

Robert,

As a man who grew up without a father, you have provided me the best fatherly wisdom I could have ever hoped for in this post. For this, I am forever in your debt. Thank you for your message and for your life. Peace be with you, friend. From now and till always, with love.",2

,,,,"You are not alone. I know you feel the love pouring out from these comments, but I just want to assure you of that. Because you just made ME feel like I'm not alone. I hope you get a chance to read this before you leave us. 

Thank you for sharing your story with me and thousands of others; you have touched a lot of people's lives in a very short period of time. You may not have children to pass your wisdom down to, but I assure you, I will be revisiting this lovely letter to remind myself of the fragility and beauty of life. 

I am twenty years old. My father just dropped dead in September. I flunked out of this semester of college; it will be difficult to go back. I am feeling the pain of his absence, and the pain of (what feels like) my own failure, every day, on top of depression and a severe instance of panic disorder. I have aspirations but I'm not really sure if I'll ever get there; I'm afraid to chase my dreams and travel the world because I'm scared of not being financially stable. It's a really shitty thing in our society that pursuing our passions and humbling ourselves with other cultures, lands, and religions is considered a luxury, if not sometimes even frowned upon.

Your words have resonated with me.

I'm not a believer in religion, really. I'm not an atheist though, so I guess I could be considered agnostic. I commend you for keeping an open mind and making peace with whatever awaits all of us on the ""other side."" 

I'll be praying to whatever universal entity might be listening, in case anyone IS listening. And thank you so much for helping me to put some of my current stressors in perspective. You have reminded me to take care of my body, cherish the people I love, and leave my mind open. I feel a certain heaviness in my heart knowing that it's under your circumstances that I had to he reminded of those things. But, what a beautiful thing to make of your last days, and your last words. 

Much love to you. Please have sweet dreams.
Sincerely,
Tara R.",2

,,,,"Hi Robert, 

I do not know you and I cannot possibly imagine the immensity of everything you must be feeling, but through your words I am able to understand you a little better and get a glimpse of who you are. It pains me that I will never get to know you. Even as a distant friend on the internet. Your thoughts on life and death describe all of my deepest fears and highest hopes so eloquently. I am grateful that you have taken the time to write this for all of us despite having no obligation to do so. From the bottom of my heart - thank you. 

I am astounded that you are able to face this with such bravery and dignity. I know that your words will have a profound effect on many many peoples lives. People who are scared and confused and lost in this life that is so often suffered through. People reading this post right now and getting up to hug their loved ones. You have taken this horrible situation and forged a beautiful example from it for all of us. Truly making lemonade :) 

Earlier this year I suffered a severe stroke at the age of 24. At the time, there was also a suicide in the family which broke us. I recovered, but fell into a deep depression that felt like a bottomless pit. I still haven't clawed my way out. Every day is a battle, and I never know what the next day will hold. If I'll be able to get up. If I'll be able to feel anything but total dread. When those days come, I will read this again to remind myself that life, as you put it, is a gift. My heart goes out to you in this difficult time. You are not alone. 

Your friend from the void.

I'm so sorry you have so little time, it's not fair or just. But you have touched many lives, perhaps far more than almost any of us ever will. You should know that you have really made a difference to a great number of people.

I wish you peace and an end to your suffering my friend. Like so many others here I wish there was more I could do for you directly, but as there is not I'll be donating to 'road to recovery trust' (a local addiction charity).

When it comes to the word “love”. The English language is regrettably limited. So instead, I’d like to defer to the Grecian language. Instead, I’d like to convey Philia. 
Philia is a fashion of “love”, meaning authentic friendship, shared goodwill, or a brotherly/sisterly bond. I would bargain to say that is a feeling we all share with you here today.

There is so much love and human compassion in this chaotic world still, available to anyone with the courage to reach out.  I'm so glad you found that love here, and that in your final moments it can help you to meet death with peaceful understanding... your courage is so impressive to me, even if you don't feel courageous, what you're doing is brave, I think all those who face death are brave in the end.  You've touched so many people's lives just with these posts at the end of your life... so on behalf of myself & everyone who has read & benefited from your words & story, thank you, for existing and for putting yourself out there, you've made a lasting impact that will stretch farther than you could ever know.

What colors will we see before our eyes

Or the fields where old heroes ride

For at death all must fade to sand

You were a flawed, flawed man, yet you used your final days to spread such a beautiful and powerful message. Up until now I was a casual smoker; not anymore. And I promise you this; you will never leave my heart, or any of our hearts. For as long as I'm around your memory will never be forgotten, and I will carry your final words in my heart forever. I know that now you've found tranquility and happiness far, far beyond our minds. And I know for a fact that your father no longer holds any grudge or ill will against you, he has forgiven you and loves you, his pride and joy, as do we. Starting tomorrow changes are in order. I'm ready to enjoy my life again, to accept a helping hand, to get out there and live a damn good life full of laughs and service to others, all while carrying you with me. It's not bullshit when they say positivity is contagious, your words spoke directly to me, your last wish came true my friend. I love you too, and I'll see you one day soon. 

Love,

Your post made me realize how much i'm wasting my life on pointless stuff. I have many dreams I want to achieve, but i'm just too lazy to do anything. I play video games and stay inside all the time. I want to change. I always wanted to change. But I think you might be the person who moved me enough. I will give you this gift, Robert. I can't keep promises to myself, so I give this promise to you. I do not smoke, but I have other bad habits to get rid off. The promise I give to you is that I will not play games or stay on the internet for the next week. I will try to reach my goals one baby step at a time. it is going to be extremely hard, I know this as I tried this many times, but I just can't fail you. Thank you Robert. You mean so much to me.

,,,,">There['s] a nicotine patch on my arm. A reminder of one of the several self destructive habits that brought me here. My smoking habit was not had enough to set things off this quickly, but it clearly did not help. For those of you who smoke, I have but one message: stop it. Please. **You think you will wait till you are ready. You will never be ready. You say you will quit tomorrow, but then tomorrow becomes today, and you are never ready today, only tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes. Today is the only day in which the decision can be made.** You can only quit TODAY. Do so now. Throw your cigarettes in the trash. Do it for me. What a gift it would be that my post would free you of tobacco's golden chains.


I've been talking about wanting to quit for quite a while now. I've had a few successes, 6 weeks here and a few months there. But this last time has been even more difficult to just actually get my mind set to quit.



Today marks 1 week, and 2 days. The moment I read this, it was the last cigarette I had that night. The next day was the last day I smoked.



If it weren't for the perspective that Today is the only day that a decision can be made, I might not have ever quit.


I know there were feelings of regret, and not having anyone to pass your knowledge to, but that obviously wasn't the case. You helped me.


Godspeed.",2

Robert, you are not alone. Thank you for sharing your time with us. Thank you for fighting. I wish you nothing but an easy transition. I wish you peace. And I ask that you watch over us. Death does not have to be dark. Death is light.

As he comes to realize that knifes only come with regret, he takes on to his self test to conjure up forgiveness, self-bettering, his last words having meaning, taking it for granted is something he denied scheming. As night makes him lose his breath he raises to the sky, the man who once was dead inside is happy and somewhere out there alive, let’s hope that his walk is not done and he will stay with the Christ.

My best to the family of this man, he says he had none but I know someone out there will cry for him.",2

Let me begin by saying what a gift you've given the world by sharing your thoughts and experiences. Your gift will live on in the hearts of all who have listened. I've never done drugs but we all have our vices, don't we? Spending too much time watching TV, too much time looking at a phone, too much time worrying about what others think. You're right: we waste far too much time on inconsequential matters. We focus on material objects and envy others when we should be practicing humility and gratitude. I'm guilty of it too.

I want you to know that you have been heard. Your message has reached us. Whenever I am feeling envious, or proud, or ashamed of myself I will remember what you shared with us. I will think, ""This is enough. I am not more nor am I less than anyone else. I love and am loved in return.""

,,,,I wanted to add something. I was married once... lost my husband to suicide. I did drugs after. Found God later in life... to find a lover who smokes. It hurts me because I know I could watch someone I love die from cancer. I started smoking... in my mind... because if he was slowly killing himself... so would I.  Its been on and off I smoke for months now... but the past couple weeks....not been feeling right inside and I cough a lot. Its a numbing dull pain. Hard to breathe. Anyhow... I kept smoking last night even. I thought... if he loved me... he wouldn't want to watch me smoke and kill myself with him.... he would quit. At this point... reading your post... I quit anyways. Because that's not love. Love isn't killing yourself to prove a point to someone they should stop killing themselves too. I just didn't want to experience the pain of losing another husband in my mind because that pain was.... yea. I should go to a doctor and get a check up soon if I dont feel better.... but I wanted to tell you... your post was the last sign from God... that I needed to stop what I was doing. Thank you ♡,4

It's hard reading the last words of a human being. Knowing they are gone forever. Knowing they no longer exist. And yet their words will still exist. They will still be heard, even if it's just for a moment.

Life may be fleeting, but you are not alone. No one's alone. And reading these posts help me realise that I'm not alone either.

Thank you Robert S.

May you rest in peace.",2

Some may say that we've all carried too much stress and grief over the last few years, and that you simply provided an outlet for all the pent up love in the world that we have yearned to give for so long. That may be true, but I can think of no-one more deserving of all of it at this instant than your good self.

You are worth all of it Robert, every last drop. Sleep well, and remember to keep your dreams big and beautiful.",1

I will teach her to cherish life, love, and live fully as you wanted and will save this for her to read in her darker moments, because those will inevitably come.  Thank you for sharing and giving her this.

Also as a physician, I’m going to print and put your words of encouragement to quit smoking TODAY, in my office.  I don’t smoke but reading those words, hell even I wanted to quit.  

Rest well my friend.",1

,,,,"Hey Robert 

I’ve just read through and I’m sorry to read all that you are going through and I pray that you get to read this message 🙏🏻 

John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”
‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV‬‬

There is one way to Heaven. Jesus said: ""I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father but by me."" (John 14:6) 

This one way is to accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior and follow God's plans for our life which are laid out in the Bible.
Good works cannot save you. Faith in Jesus alone can save you.
""For by grace you are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast."" (Ephesians 2:8-9)

I just want to give you some hope within this time of need that your going through. You have an amazing opportunity like no other right now, the Holy Bible says ‘all’ who believes in the son of God Jesus Christ will have ‘eternal life’ a hope like no other that this isn’t our final destination and we will receive a new resurrected body with no decease, no more pain, no more suffering, no more fear or tears Jesus says “behold I stand at the door and knock whoever opens I will come in and dine with you” 

All you have to do is say forgive me my sins I believe that you came to set me free 

If your thinking I’m not worthy?! Even on the cross of Calvert in the last hour of one of the other men on their cross he forgave him and said “you will be with me in paradise” a sinner up until he asked for forgiveness before he was going to die wow how incredible to know that we are loved that much by God our Heavenly Father 💚🙏🏻 

Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be your name 
, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespassed  against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever and ever 

Lord Jesus Christ I believe that you are the son of God, forgive me of my sins and release your amazing Grace and Mercey upon me so that I may share eternal life with you Amen 

May the Lord bless you Robert and keep you and turn his face towards you and grant you his peace in Jesus name I pray Amen 🙏🏻 

I will keep you in my prayers 🙏🏻 God bless all on this post too 🙏🏻 Xx",1

If there's no recordings of your voice, and if you can of course, maybe do a little video, perhaps send it to your father with the letter. It may help you, and help your father with the grief.

I'm saying this because a family member passed a couple months ago, and I have no recordings of their voice. We weren't that close but I still hit me like a ton of bricks and I wish I could hear their voice again.",1

I’m still relatively young. At only 21 I’ve experienced death only a couple of times. Freshman year of college, my grandfather whom I live with was told he had four months to live, but he passed that weekend. I was devastated that I missed it, and that I did not have a chance to speak to him.

Now I know we don’t know each other, but your story is really touching, and I really wanted to let you know that while I still have the chance. I hope you know you touched so many people here, and while we can’t be with you, we are all praying and thinking about you now. 

I read all of your regrets, all of your feelings and I will do my best to use them to help shape my life. You mention not being able to pass on life lessons, but I think there are a few in this post and I listened to them, I will follow them. I am glad it sounds like you have made some peace with death, which I am relieved to hear. 

The world is crazy right now and so much is virtual, but you have so many people here who will be with you until the end - me included. I sincerely hope that the pain stays away, and this transition is as peaceful as it can possibly be. And above all, know that your words will not be forgotten by me.

There is so much heart in your words, and so much to be gleaned from your wishes. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for reminding me that the grudge I’m holding from our little fight last night is but a blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things. Thank you for reminding me to take it easier on my children, for reminding me that life is so fleeting and these small common core standards while homeschooling aren’t so big that I have to be this chronically stressed out. I have lost an infant son, and for so long I believed that that loss would be enough for me to remember to not take my life so seriously, and yet, we all get caught back up in the rat race. I pray that you will have nothing but peace during your last hours or days, and that you rest easily knowing that your life served such a grand purpose in the way you reminded me to live the one I’ve been granted.

And thank you for really expressing that I shouldn't care what others think, analyze every word or action I do. That isn't living at all, more like a prison in my own mind. I don't want my mind to be a prison, I want it to be free and happy and able to live in the moment. 

I hope before my time comes I am able to fall in love, make a family, live a fulfilling life and feel like I was worth living it too. I will seek this out and chase my dreams with you in mind. I will do my very best to get my mom to stop smoking, I don't want to lose her sooner than I already have to. She is my best friend.

You are very brave. Thank you so much for sharing all of this with us. If there is an afterlife, some place where your conscience goes, reincarnation - whatever it may be - I truly hope that you are more satisfied with it than you were with your life here on earth. I promise you Robert, people will be thinking of you for years to come. I know I will think of you from time to time for the rest of my life. I've learned in some way how to live from your death.

""Death is an old friend waiting to greet you at the end of a long and well lived life. It can not be appreciated properly when sought in darkness. I know there is no magic fix for depression, but I urge you to get up, go out, and live the crazy, wonderful, irrational, beautiful life you want. If only I had done the same. What a gift is life!""

This is just one of the things you've said that touched me so... I am going to be saving parts of your post and printing them off to keep with me as reminders on how I want to live. I can go months or years without finding one, but I have found 3 or 4 just within your post...

You have created a community of people from around the world who are bonded together only because of you. And I have no doubt that your words will live on for many years, and be reposted and repeated many many times. That's something to be proud of as you slip away.

I remember what Roger Ebert said about consciousness existing beyond our physical lives. He said that he was perfectly content before he was born and expected to be perfectly content after he died. That's what I feel about death. I remember the few times that I've had full anesthesia. It's not like sleeping. It's one second you're counting backwards, and then bang you're in recovery. No sense of time passing, no dreams, no sleeping. Just bang, gone. I think death will be like that. It's not sleep - it's just non-existence. Like before you were born.

Bon voyage Robert.",1

Nothing you did could change a fathers love. Your words are both beautiful and poignant- a reminder to live and love with no regrets. Only people at the end of their life can truly tell you what the important things in life are. As you exit this life and enter eternity, I would love to pray for you. I hope that’s ok. 
Father, I ask for you to wrap your arms around Robert. I pray that he feels your comfort and peace that surpasses all understanding. I pray that any pain he experiences leave his body. I pray for Robert to have sweet dreams as he gently enters your kingdom. I pray that he has total peace as he leaves his earthly body. In Jesus name, Amen. 
Love and peace to you, Robert. Your life matters and please know you have had an impact on me❤️",1
,,,,"Perhaps you've experienced unexplainable things while working at a nursing home before. But I just wanted to share that I've had several patients during my ICU and med-surg times who either saw the bright light leading them or dead loved ones suddenly appearing to escort them. They did pass away shortly after. It freaked me out when my first patient kept pointing at the corner of her room and said ""wow, mom, you are still so beautiful"". I thought it was her alzheimer's talking but her nurse said ""I guess it's almost time for her"". Since then, I've experienced so many weird things like that.

So don't feel alone. Somebody is out there guiding you or perhaps has been waiting for you. I used to be an atheist but being a healthcare provider changed that completely. Just have seen too much strange things that cannot be explained through science and logic. 

I wish you a safe journey. We will get a chance to meet you one day. Not yet, but someday. Much love to you.",1

God bless you ❤️.",1
,,,,"Robert, I was on the other end of a relationship with someone in your shoes (small cell carcinoma, lung, very very fast). I have complicated feelings about him even now, years later, but as hard as it is to look back on my relationship with him and unequivocally smile, the one thing I can tell you is that there are few people that would not at the very least forgive. Try to take solace in that. 

As you said, we're there with you. You are far from alone in this, and your posts have done others immeasurable good; from entering the hearts and minds of the medical professionals here and in some small way staying with them as they treat others all the way down to the plebes like me that watch these professionals do their jobs with something like awe, and most importantly to the people that may be going through something similar in the future you have touched each one of us and entered our consciousness. 
There are two somewhat similar quotes that basically state that a man is not dead until they are forgotten and the ripples they caused in the world fade. You'll live long in our eyes for quite a long time after this.

I understand the brain. I know all the theories about consciousness. I know biology. I also know what I've experienced.

I've had heart arrythmia. Sometimes, my body enters into a panick mode. And it takes me a couple of minutes to be more lucid. I usually remember the out of body place and I'm no longer afraid. I tell my body: ""I'm not afraid"", and it helps.

I'm a 24yr old who is terrified of the thought of death, just trying to get to sleep without panicking about it is a difficult thing for me to achieve. Reading this helped somewhat understand how I can deal with it. I'm tearing up whilst I write this because the suffering you've gone through is immeasurable but you still found the time to write your final statement to the world and it's helping so many people. You gripped my attention and I felt so sad knowing at some point the paragraphs would end.

You may have struggled in life, but at least you got a say in your final moments, I hope you make it to Tuesday at least if it's not too painful, just so you get to understand and be in this world a little longer and appreciate how amazing it is to be actually alive.

You are loved by people the world over. And I'm sure if your Dad was able to find you he would be right there with you holding you hand, don't feel like you disgraced him, he's hurt like you are hurt but love transcends pain. I hope your last days are comfortable, good luck wherever you end up.",1
,,,,"You have touched so many lives, mine also. I will try to live my life outrageously and remember to value people over material goods. Have a good rest, see you on the other side sir.",1
,,,,Certainly such a beautiful soul will continue on after death. I am wrapping my arms around you from afar. All of us are. Xo,1
,,,,May you find peace. Thank you for existing.,1
,,,,"Please know that even though you have those regrets about not having children to be with you at the end or to pass your lessons on to, nothing was in vain - look at the impression you've made on all these people commenting. Your words are valuable, and many of us will carry them with us long after you go. 

Sleep well, and I hope that when my end comes, I can face it with even half the grace you've shown. We are with you in spirit.",1
,,,,Robert you touched my heart and soul! I am currently crying and I am typing this looking through a curtain of tears. I'm going to share this with friends and we will continue to appreciate life! I am sorry to hear that you missed some opportunities in life like traveling this beautiful earth and having children but I am comforted by the fact that you seem to be in peace now. I am planning to do a world trip in 1 1/2 years to exchange some of the green pieces of paper for experiences and memories. Have a good ride to the other side!,1
,,,,Good luck on the other side. We'll see you.,1

All I can hope is when my final chapter comes to a close, that I can face it with equal clarity and grace.",1
,,,,Try not to regret.  Hindsight is 20/20 - part of learning ;)  Bon Voyage,1
,,,,"The dignity you're displaying is beyond remarkable and I feel it displays the very best of humanity.

We all make mistakes and have regrets, but be generous with yourself right now. Think of your triumphs too: I know you have some. The small kindnesses you bestowed on strangers throughout your life, the smiles you shared. But beyond that, the incredible insight you have given us into the last weeks of your life. That is a legacy unto itself.

When people here say you're not alone, that you have us, they're right in more ways than you know. I'm not religious, but even so I know myself to be part of a very real and tangible thriving mass of humanity. We don't all get it right all of the time, but the important thing is that we try. 

It's sad that not all your letters will be sent, but it matters that you tried. Because that's what joins us all. Fear, redemption, hope, memory, so much more. You're one of us right here on Reddit, but you're also part of the world outside your room. You have contributed to society by your very existence.

Sleep well. I will always, always remember the posts you have shared with us and I know many other people feel the same way. You couldn't be alone now even if you tried, because you have touched so many lives just with your posts to us.",1

I hope your remaining time is that of peace and love.",1

Reading all of these comments and stories hopefully lets you realise the impact that your spirit and life has had, even in this post, to all of these people around the world. I will be thinking of you. Thank you for passing on your wisdom and lessons. I will do my very best to put a few into action TODAY, and of course in tothe future. I’m sure many others have and will too. In the light, you do live on. Your spirit lives on.

Sending love your way. Rest easy. We all love you.",1
,,,,"I know it isn't truly my place to say so, but   


All is forgiven Robert.




Eventually mortality catches up with us all and I choose to believe the process brings us all to a place of peace - Where we can seek and give forgiveness in ways we thought we couldn't with the weight of daily living. I believe those you seek forgiveness from would give it to you. 


My heart is full of love and gratitude for you.


I wish you peace.",1
,,,,"I was diagnosed with cancer last year, although I am still young and healthy now, I'm still afraid, there's no one around me that understand my fear.

I feel fortunate to have been able to read your posts.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us.  You have inspired so many to stop getting caught up in bull shit, and to start living their best life.  We all have things we regret.  Some of us have been unkind or downright cruel to others, but to learn from our mistakes and try to become something better, not just for ourselves, but for others is the best way to make amends.  You have more than done that with your words.  You have inspired so many to go out there and live our best lives.  You will live on forever in the new found respect for our lives.  Its what you do last that counts.  Thank you so much.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you.  If you are able to reply or message me, please do.

,,,,"I knew a man who changed my life, a kind caring man and his wife took me in as a foster child for a time and showed me love and a caring home. He also was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer, thought he had a few weeks, but it was two days from diagnosis to passing. He used to work on the shipyards in the Navy, back when asbestos wasn't so looked badly upon.

I haven't commented before, because well I'm not a doctor, child of a doc, I'm a former EMT and now disabled chronic pain patient from a genetic disorder, who sometimes comes here for advice, but mostly to watch as others get answers and to learn as I never wanted to stop learning.But today you have taught all of us. Not just doctors, but us as humans. I had read your posts, hoping you would receive good palliative care. It seems they got that managed and have given you choices. I am sad that not everyone gets that.

I think about the impacts it could have had in other cases like yours and others. My mother likely had the genetic disorder I have that doesn't go away, but because she was cut off cold turkey from all pain management back at the beginning of the opioid crisis, she instead shot herself. I can't help but think that palliative care in some situations should be recognized as a human right. It hurts me to hear your story of the person given a pain pump, but the doctor didn't even recognize someone could be too ill to press such a pump. This is the importance of looking at the human as a whole in care.  


Btw I also donated her body to science through Science Care. I had no money at the time and they sent a letter telling me how she contributed in death as well as a little glass sculpture thing to commemorate her, along with her ashes.

You are not alone and there are many here with you. I hope that the universe, whatever you may believe, grants you a good death. I think the gift of a good death is so very precious and you have reminded us again how precious this is and the choices we make both in life and death.I have learned from you.

Thank you for taking this time to share with us the truth you are seeing. It is out duty to take your words and apply it to our lives. 

Thank you for putting money, time, work, and relationships in perspective for us. Your words are healing us that are suffering through ignorance and blindness to the ultimate truth, and thank you for reminding us of the gift that life is, and that we tend not to see on a day to day basis. 

(This is my personal perspective and I share for the possibility that these words offer any consolation.) In my personal spiritual practice I have seen that our essence (consciousness/the soul) is everpresent and unconditional love. Yes this body will leave this world but YOU are infinite awareness and love. Once this body goes, you remain as the infinite love that you are and always have been. You will return to the state of absolute bliss that is your natural state and come back when you feel like you want to experience another life. 

Sending you all the love in my heart right now. You're not alone. You're never alone. Your mind may say otherwise but you are loved and will always be loved. Ultimate love gave you this life for you to explore, discover and be and do whatever you want without judgement and you did exactly that. God does not judge. He wants us to experience this life (playground) however we want. You banged out 41 years like a boss knocked it out the park. Good job man. 

I love you man. Open your heart. Forgive yourself if possible/necessary. This life is hard and you lived it. I'm proud of you for all that you have done. No judgement. Just love you for being you. 

Be well and rest your heart in love brother. We're all here with you. (God/the universe) unconditional love is holding you in his arms right now as he has always been since the day baby you came to this planet. He will continue to hold you in his unconditional love infinitely after this body leaves this planet. Thank you for sharing your heart during this time. Wishing you find/do/receive anything that your heart is yearning for at this moment. 

Love you and sending you extra prayers at this moment  ♥️",1

I share your views on the Hereafter, but maybe it *will* be 'An Awfully Big Adventure' I guess we'll all find out one day; but your post has probably helped push that 'one day' a bit further into the future for many people who have read it.

Anyone you wanted forgiveness from will forgive. Don’t dwell on the past as we cannot change it. Your past has made you who you are both good and bad. From what I can see there’s more good than bad. We all go down paths we regret but it’s what we do to get off those paths that hurt us. 

Your dad forgives you and will probably be upset when he learns that he couldn’t say goodbye. I’d at least share this post on your other social media pages if you have them. 

I agree with you that cigarettes are horrible. My father passed away from COPD and I feared smoking as I already have cancer and didn’t want to mess with my odds of spreading cancer from the brain to other areas. 

I’ve sat with my grandfather when he was in hospice and it was a horrible feeling watching him when I couldn’t do anything to help him. Death rattle set in two days after he started hospice care and died five days later. On that note I wish a quick painless passing.",1

Years ago I read a post on here about a kid, just 24, who picked out his last tie. It was a ducky tie. I can’t find the post anymore unfortunately but I have it printed out and framed. He said many of the same things you did about cherishing life and I still carry it with me years later. Your words will hold a similar place in my heart and I hope that brings you solace that, although you have no kids to learn your lessons, you have friends in the world who heed your words and will carry them into the future.

It is traveling through the vast expanse hitting all of our screens and sending a flurry of electrical signals in our own brains keeping us there with you. When you pass on, you will have the privilege of knowing what happens after the end. The greatest question of all time will be answered, and I find myself humbled knowing you are at this threshold. There is such a thing as the concept of a star child. The final evolution of our consciousness. Being able to freely travel as a field of energy anywhere you wish, time dilating as you see fit.

I am 35 and have spent most of my life comfortably non-spiritual.

Like you say, we spend so long worrying and so long chasing security through money - a little security is good, but a little joy, experience, love and even heartbreak are worth so much more. It’s easy to say I’ll take your words and live a better life, even in a small way, for having read them, but it’s easy to fall back into what’s familiar and feels safe, even if it doesn’t make our heart sing. But I’ll try. I’m sure we all will, to be a little better and do a little more, because of the time you’ve kindly given us in your final hours to write this - as I said, beautiful words, but an even more beautiful gift. I hope you depart well and without fear and pain. You are loved. And I thank you, from Hannah in England. You are not alone.",1

i'm not much for religion, but i do pray in my own way; i will be praying for your comfort in this process. i believe in reincarnation, and so i pray that you could come back around in another form, to greet us all again, to fulfill wishes from this life in another.

it's hard to know what to say; i wanted to try anyways, because your post impacted me profoundly. THANK YOU for this wake-up call. 

i don't wish to overshare, but when i was 14 i got extremely sick; doctors told my parents that i would likely die within a week. my illness was much less absolute than yours, though. there were some botched surgeries, sepsis, ICU time, and other close calls, but i managed to survive.

since then, though, i've been stagnating. even with the first hand experience of coding out and nearly dying, i have just... been reckless with my health, my life, my decisions. even i don't understand it fully, but my best guess is that i just feel ""invincible,"" like nothing really matters.

your perspective from a much more concrete certainty of death has helped me realize it matters, it all matters a LOT. i can do better. and so, Robert, thank you; i'm gonna get rid of this vape, try to go back to my healthier diet, and _do better._",1
,,,,Safe travels brother.,1
,,,,"Dear Robert,

&#x200B;

I am moved by your words. I cannot understand what you are going trough, but you are a wonderful person and your teachings about life will be with me. I am younger than you, I am 23, but is thanks to people like you that everyone can and must aspire to be a better person. 

I will tell you a tale I red some time ago. I had a terrible fear of dying, and I still have sorta, but I am managing to use it as a way to live better. So, I bought a book that was about the death and the fact that we should accept it as natural, written by Irvine Yalom. It contained a story that told about a wealthy man who was dying. On the death bed there were three figures, Wealth, Money and Fame, or similar ( I can't remember right now the exact metaphores, but I hope you could catch the sense). The dying man asked if they were coming with him, but they said no, they could not. But then it came the Good Actions, who held the hand of the man and flew away with him. Well, from my point of view you just did this and I am so glad I red your posts and this farewell. I will keep a place for you and your words in my heart. 

See you on the other side, Robert. I hope when my day comes I will be as sharp and as caring as you are. All of us love you deeply!",1

,,,,You are an amazing person. I have never met you but I want you to know. I currently work in a nursing home and the stress makes me want to smoke. I quit 5 years back when my fiancee daughter(at the time was 2) asked to come out because she wanted to smoke too.  It has been very hard recently to fight the urge. You my friend YES you are a friend just gave me another reason to not restart smoking. I sit here soaking in the tub after a long hard day tears rolling down my face as so many thing you said have hit so hard. The fact money is just paper and coins. Working all the over time is not really worth it.  Time is limited spend it well.  Thank you for the motivation and strength to keep pushing on. We are there by your side mentally.

""No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away - until the clock he wound winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone’s life…is only the core of their actual existence. "" - Terry Pratchett

When you're in a hospital, you're there with the hope that you may get better. When you're in a hospice, you're there because you won't. That can't be an easy job to have. Then it's important to remember that many hospices are staffed heavily by volunteers. 

My uncle was in one and his children swore blind (and continue to this day) that they treated him with so much respect and compassion and made his passing as easy as can be expected.

Ever since then, if I ever see my local hospice collecting money, I give them whatever I can then.

I do not think that you'll read this among the 1.300 comments but it did not feel right to not respond to your post.

My mother died on the 29 of october this year from lung cancer. Much like you, she smoked since she was 18 years old. I often told her that she needs to quit but it was in vein. My mother quit smoking on the day she was hospitalized - but it was already too late. She came into the hospital because she couldnt move her legs anymore. After much tests it was found out that tumor tissue in her spinal cord was the reason. The tissue spread from her lung into the spinal cord and from there into the brain. She was hospitalized on the 08 of September. Six weeks later she died in here own home - in here own living Room with her husband and her three children by her side till the last breath.

I want to thank you for your Post. I couldnt stop the tears coming from my eyes whilst reading your Text. I too have smoked for nearly 13 years - a pack of cigeretters a day. I quit roughly three weeks before my mother was hospitalized, in mid august. After my mother died I promised myself that I'd never Touch a cigerette in my life again. Thanks to you I'll have two reasons now. 

I hope your last hours will be as peaceful as my mothers were. Thank you for letting me share my story. I wish you all the best up there and greet my mother. I'll never forget this thread and your name - Robert.

I'll say farewell to you Robert with a quote that helped me the past two weeks. Till me meet in the afterlife.

No matter how hard the feelings may get, parents have a small piece of their soul that still wants to think the best of their kids.

As a dad that isn't yours, please take no offense and believe I don't presume to have any major impact on your guilt or grief, but...

I forgive you. I forgive you poor decisions made in the depths of disease. I forgive you the fact that your disease led to so much frustration, guilt, anxiety, concern, and hard feelings. I forgive you the disappearances, thefts, harm, and lost contact. What is happening now is not your fault. What time has passed between then and now is a moment compared to how long I've cared for you. I forgive you. And whether you believe it or not, I love you. Go with peace, go with grace, go with the knowledge you are not truly alone when there is still love for you in this world. 

If you get a chance to read this, there is no need to reply. Hold onto the idea that your dad loves you no matter where he is. He may never know what happened and that likely grieves him. That may be the only way he has left, in his private moments and deepest thoughts, to express his love for you but I promise he feels it.

Go with grace, my friend. You are loved.",1

Dont underestimate how much people care about complete strangers. We all live different lives, maybe thousands of miles away, but we've all always been in this together. We're all family on this planet. And I think it's for a reason that people have the ability to care about others so deeply. I truly dont think there's anything stronger in the world than love. I believe it can cure the deepest sadness and light up the darkest souls. And it makes life worth living. Even if we can only be here for a short time. At least we did it together. 

I hope the best for you. I hope you know people cared about you. And I hope you can smile and be happy and be at peace and know that goodbye is not forever.

Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,

You are so loved, there is nothing but love for us all and I hope you can feel it in the peace you feel from time to time between the fear and possible pain.

We hope you’re not afraid, chances are you won’t be moving forward. You seem like you’re accepting things as they come and may we all be so brave and giving when we are in your place. 

I will be thinking of you and therefore with you in some small formless form. You may not read this at all as you have so many nice messages to read, but I hope a part of you feels how deeply you’ve touched many souls and helped show what’s important in life. 

I will take what you’ve written and share it with others. These are things everyone must know and sooner than later. Thank you for your kindness, generosity and strength. The world will be less without you in it.

,,,,"It's currently very late where I live, and I was having a quick scroll through Reddit before I fall asleep. Instead I'm lying in bed weeping for a man I do not know. This post is the first I had heard of you, but your words have affected me for reasons I can't quite understand or explain. At this time I hope to one day study medicine and become a doctor, and your story has helped me to realise the weight of that decision. 

As much as fate can be cruel in the way it chooses to dish out diseases, your demeanor and all the other comments from people throwing away cigarettes and offering their help has left me feeling much more optimistic about the world. I've struggled with my mood and depression in the past, and I'm going to do my best to heed your advice and make the most of my life. 

Usually whenever I don't feel capable of bringing myself to do something I tell myself I'm doing it for someone. I'll remember your name Robert, your name will be the one that comes to mind when I push myself to apply to study medicine, when I sit exams, and hopefully one day when I graduate.

I hope you are comfortable and doing ok. As much as you wrote about your wrongdoings in life, making amends etc I can see that you have good in your heart. 

All the best Robert,
Scott",1

I will try to take it to heart and live my life in a more loving way. You are a beautiful person - nothing in your past can change what a wonderful human being you are in the present. Your words have moved me beyond words.

&nbsp;

I pray and hope that you will seek and receive all of God's grace and mercy, and will receive salvation through our Lord, Jesus Christ. I truly believe that every one of us needs God to save us from our sins. He understands, and he loves us anyway. Seek Him in your heart, and He will welcome you with a smile and open arms as you come home to Him. God and all the angels and saints will rejoice more if you turn to God than if 100 believers keep on believing. God loves you infinitely, Robert. I feel compelled to say this, because I love you as a fellow human being, and hope that I may meet you in Heaven one day and call you a friend. No matter what you believe, I sincerely wish you peace and comfort.

You may never read this comment. I pray that, somehow, God will make you know it without reading it, and that you will feel the love all of us imperfect people want to send to you, from our hearts. Thank you, and all peace, all comfort, all love, and in Heaven all perfect joy be with you.",1

Im a smoker. I smoke tobacco mixed with cannabis, thanks to you im gonna try to eliminate tobacco from my life.

I had given up on love because traumatic past experiences, but because of you I may be more open to it.

I torture myself with depressing thoughts every day, maybe my mental health is not that on point. Thanks to you im gonna make my best effort to appreciate every aspect of life more every day.

I wish you a peacefull ending and a beautiful beggining of what may come next, cause after all, we are jst mokeys made out of chemicals so, who knows if conscience remains or not? Whatever happens, you connected with us and for that I thank you brother",1
,,,,"Reading this was undoubtedly the most needed thing in my life. I just hate that it could only happen as your complete your journey. 

I'm a college student taking a smoke break to waste time on my phone, and this is the only thing I've read on here that makes me I happy I was apart of. 

I have no words or advice to give, but so much gratitude and thanks for someone I will not meet in this lifetime. I've been outside crying for nearly an hour while calling my siblings, but I don't think they will ever understand the impact that you, Robert S., has had on my distant life. 

I don't know if I believe in karma or sin, but you have a solid 1-0 record in my book, for what it's worth.",1
,,,,"I already posted earlier expressing many of the thoughts I hoped to convey, but in the hopes you read this as well, I am posting this as its own comment.

In my earlier comment, I mentioned that you have surely changed many lives for the better. I would like to add that you may have changed mine. I know that in the grand scheme of things, some of my aspirations are largely selfish. I love cars, I enjoy driving them, and I naturally get a thrill from accelerating faster than strictly necessary, and taking turns faster than than is perfectly comfortable (all while avoiding putting innocent people in any danger, of course. I'm not that selfish.) 

You are right in that it is best to enjoy your life, however strangely it may be, so long as it doesn't hurt others. I had been considering trying to race (on a track) once COVID is over, and going to a racing school. Your post has made me realize I should definitely try to pursue this, as life isn't forever, and when my time comes, I would at least know that I tried to pursue something I enjoy, whether or not I succeed. Thank you for making me realize this.

Another thing I mentioned in my earlier comment is that for average people that aren't Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar, the best way to live forever and be remembered is to be kind. I still stand by that statement, but I would like to add to that. Those people aren't remembered because they were kind, far from it,  but because the changes they made in the world are easily quantified. The changes you have made are not so easily measured, and while you will not be remembered by all for taking power in Rome, you will be remembered by the people here that have read your kind words, and that is no less memorable and no less important.",1

We've never met, and I doubt you'll ever read this message, but I just wanted to say, I will never ever forget you. One day, when I'm staring down the face of my own mortality I will pray that I can handle it with as much grace as you have. 

May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face; the rains fall soft upon your fields and until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His hand.

I’m here if you need to talk. I’m sorry for your situation. Hospice will take great care of you. 

It’s hard for me to emotionally reach out to people but I just wanted you to know your words touched me. I’m already doing all I can to live without wasting my life but I also will never have children. Dying alone is a fear but it’s less so now because you are not alone. We’re all here. 

Being at home was the right decision. I’ve seen both. Sleep in peace and comfort. Let us know if there’s anything on the other side, would you? We’re here though.",1

,,,,"Forgiveness is for the other person’s sake—not for you. Forgiveness makes the person who has forgiven the offender feel better. I don’t know you or your story but I want you to know that since that’s clearly something that has you tied up. The solace to be found in this is, I feel, is that you have an opportunity to realize that even if your best wasn’t good, strictly speaking, you did your best with what you had.

I’m saying this as the person who watched my mom dying, angry and embittered for the kind of person she was. She was not a good person, strictly speaking, in my eyes. But, she was probably doing the best she could with what she knew and had to work with.

Forgive yourself for your mistakes. It’s the end of this life anyway, right? What do you have to lose?

For what it’s worth, if you do get around to reading this, you’ve impacted another person. I’m that much closer to being able to forgive my mom for what she was to me.",1

The post of someone who is facing immense pain and suffering and inevitable death at any moment, and it immediately grounds you. Someone most of us do not know at all, and then become emotional and introspective. I have no idea what to say and hopefully Roberts post(s) will resonate with as many people as possible. Godspeed on your journey Robert...and I’m truly hoping it does not end here for you, or any of us for that matter, and that maybe this life we live, as joyous/painful/amazing/sorrowful/mysterious/enlightening as it can be at times, is indeed just the beginning...",1

,,,,"Be near me when my light is low,
When the blood creeps, and the nerves prick
And tingle; and the heart is sick,
And all the wheels of Being slow.

Be near me when the sensuous frame
Is rack'd with pangs that conquer trust;
And Time, a maniac scattering dust,
And Life, a fury slinging flame.

Be near me when my faith is dry,
And men the flies of latter spring,
That lay their eggs, and sting and sing
And weave their petty cells and die.

Be near me when I fade away,
To point the term of human strife,
And on the low dark verge of life
The twilight of eternal day.

Alfred Lord Tennyson, In Memoriam",1

,,,,"I have no words which would mean much of anything. Only thoughts, which you may or may not read.

There’s a slight bit of jealousy in my mind, envious that you get to see (or not) what happens (or doesn’t) once our bodies die. I am so curious about that.

There is thankfulness, and yet another bit of wavering, but 100% committed-to resolve. To break from chasing “green papers and metal discs”. 

There is sadness coupled with thanks, that these realizations are coming only so close to the end of life. I hope I bear the solemn responsibility of one who has read them in a manner which would make you proud.

Lastly, there is a wish that you would know that so many are aware of what you’re going through. There are a host of fellow points of conscious existence who wave “goodbye”, for now, or who knows. 

Rest well, Robert S. ❤️",1

And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.
And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.

,,,,"Your words have touched me in a way I can’t properly verbalize. I’m struggling with addiction myself, and my relationship with the man I consider my soulmate is crumbling as a result of the battle we’re fighting both as individuals and as a unit. I had a previous partner die of an overdose next to me in bed. I watched the life leave his eyes. I can’t explain it, but somehow I knew the exact moment his soul transcended and he was gone. I learned a valuable lesson that night and have tried desperately to live my life by them. Sometimes, though, it’s easy to get caught up in daily life and the petty squabbles it brings. This post gave me a refresher I was in dire need of. You just never know when you’re number is up. Thank you for being so generous and selfless to use what little strength you have remaining to try to pass down some of your priceless wisdom. I cannot personally thank you enough.

This is so sad.

The user had never been verified.

The hospice nurse bypassed the protection lock on the user’s phone, entered his Reddit account in violation of the terms of service, and allegedly posted her own message under his account name. A poetic act of duty that would never be carried out, since it is not only a violation of her patient’s privacy, but also could potentially get her fired. Even if she had, the notion she would have signed it with her first name and last initial is preposterous.

Patient said every breath was harder than the last, yet spent his time composing a huge message with professional-level grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Surprisingly polished for a junkie on his way out, channeling his inner Randy Pausch we are to suppose.

The doula and the patient use the same sentence structure, same construction, and the same mannerisms. Some of the ideas were clipped short in the second post to try to hide this, but not all.  The spelling of patient’s first name, which under no circumstances would ever be released publicly, especially given his prescription history, was altered once to give the impression that it wasn’t the original author in that the caregiver was somehow unsure of it and also somehow alarmingly non-detail-oriented for a nurse.

This post followed hard after three other suspicious position anecdote posts. Two emphasized and seemed to even embellish the seriousness of covid symptoms. One other turned end-of-life care into a horror story about a patient ripping his own fingernails out, leading the readers to conclude the need for death with dignity/ assisted suicide laws in preparation for an organized push for federal legislation.

The reuse of the phrase “tearing my fingernails out” makes me wonder if this was originally purchased as another COvid tale about breathing problems but then was altered to a death-with-dignity piece.",1

Thank you for writing this, for sharing with such courage. and if you don't mind, I've got two thoughts to share back with a special to my heart book that I've read a billion times that I feel is relevant. I hope it brings your mind a little peace and wonder, before the end.   


Firstly, I hope these messages shine bright and far, like the light of Earendil, as though you were holding now the glass phial from Galadriel herself of the most beloved star. Hold it close to you now, in your mind, shining warm and bright and comforting.

Secondly, I've always felt this moment from Lord of the Rings really helped me look at my own departure with a small measure of comfort too. When things are at their darkest, enveloped in fear, Pippin turns to Gandalf and says, ""I didn't think it would end this way.""Gandalf responds, ""End? No. the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass. And then you see it."" Pippin curiously replies, ""What? Gandalf, see what?"" and Gandalf wisely smiles back and replies, ""White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise."" Pippin, with some relief replies ""Well, that isn't so bad."" And Gandalf reassures him, ""No, no it isn't.""

May you find peace under a swift sunrise, passing onto whatever next realm there is to be found. Thank you friend for your courage, wisdom, and me and my 3 kitties are sending you light and love. You've touched me with your words. Sleep well!!",1

“Death is an old friend waiting at the end of a life well-lived. It can’t be appreciated in darkness.”

Suddenly, after all these years, I feel differently about death. I feel that there is peace and rest for our souls and for our toils.

I’m not sure if you are still with us at the moment, but I nevertheless wanted to leave you with a warm statement from my favorite philosopher, Epicurus. The following letter was written on the day of his death to one of his dearest friends:

**Letter to Idomeneus:**
“I write this to you while experiencing a blessedly happy day, and at the same time the last day of my life. Urinary blockages and dysenteric discomforts afflict me which could not be surpassed for their intensity. But against all of these things are ranged the joy in my soul produced by the recollection of the discussions we have had. Please take care of the children of Metrodorus in a manner worthy of the good disposition you have had since adolescence towards me and towards philosophy”

Epicurus died a slow and painful death, but nevertheless considered the last day of his life to be a blessed one. Not because his life was coming to a close, but because of the joy he was able to glean from his memories. If you’re still with us, I hope you can rest easy recalling all of the kind people in this subreddit who are here for you. Likewise, I hope anyone who reads this and feels currently in pain or distress takes some level of comfort from my post.

All the best.",1

Thank you for sharing this post. I know you came here to say goodbye and to feel like you’re not alone, but instead you’ve given of yourself. You’ve given us all a glimpse into something many of us won’t know about until it’s too late. Your words are wise and impactful. Your writing and sentiment beautiful. I’m a nurse, a mom. If you were my patient, I’d sit with you. I’ve done it in the past with people who didn’t have family and I always hoped they knew they weren’t alone. I’m sorry you don’t have anyone to do that. Your dad forgives you. He does. These words of yours will be comforting for him to read and know you’re ok now, and at peace. I hope he sees them. I would want to if you were my son. You do not sleep alone. Many of us are with you. I will keep this post up all night so you are beside me. Rest easy, my friend. Good night.",1

For reaching out

Over sadness

And over doubt

Toward all

that is wonder

For believing, loving,

Feeling, seeing,

The gift of Earth

The miracle of being  

These excerpts are from Nila J. Webster's picture book The Gift of You, The Gift of Me. 

I found the book in the small sitting room at the hospice house where my mother spent her final weeks. 

Something about this poem filled me with peace and a feeling of profound gratitude just being allowed to accompany my mother on the most personal journey.

Robert, it's truly an honor to be here with you.  Godspeed, friend.",1

Your Dad forgives you. He just doesn’t know how to reach you to tell you so. ❤️",1
,,,,"I just got home from work and read this beautiful post. now I'm bawling and heartbroken over a stranger so Thank You lol! 

I wanted to tell you, you have the heart and soul of a poet. don't worry about receiving the gift of forgiveness from others, before you go, but *please forgive yourself*. 

how would any of us be remembered if we were judged by our worst day? 

people find reasons to become better versions of themselves all the time. sometimes they hit rock bottom and lose everything they love before they are ready to make that change. sometimes it's for a positive reason, like having a baby and they want to be better for them. 

sometimes it's an unexpected death sentence that urges them to make themselves better while they still hold onto that precious gift of life they have left. 

no one reason is better than another. nothing makes the change more or less valid. you are clearly thankful you have time at ALL, when any one of us could die in a tragic accident instantaneously, with no opportunity to make amends. 

I am so proud of you for reaching out. not facing this alone. no one deserves to be alone in their final moments. I don't know you, but know that I love you. it will be okay. this too shall pass. 

one thing that helps me not be afraid of death, is the knowledge that you don't have to know how to do it. everyone before you has done it. and everyone after you will eventually do it as well. you're about to learn the answer to life's greatest mystery! 

I hope you rest easy, with a heart that's full of love.

and peace.",1

May your soul rest well and may you never be forgotten. I will keep you in my thoughts. Even though this is a very hard time I want to thank you for sharing your story.

Without light the universe would be dark, without darkness the universe would be too lit. Balance. Life and death. Death is but another step into a new existence.

,,,,"Hello Robert❤️my aunt also passed away the exact same way, she also was alone, had no children, she did not believe in a specific religion, she believed in a superior Diety, she harmed no one and kept for herself most of the time.

When she passed, I often dreamt of her, when I did I would give out some money to the homeless, help stray animals in her name (I advise all redditors to do the same for Robert no matter what your religion is) I once had a dream of her bedroom with an open window and her room was a hospital bed and closed suitcases, and the window was looking into beautiful natural scene with wind flying and moving the curtains, it was as if her soul flew into a beautiful world through the window❤️ the way you pass is a sign that God loves you and wants to prepare you for a sin-free after life, I know many people don’t believe that, but I hope that this message reaches you at least so you would be aware of it❤️ don’t be afraid ❤️ God loves you and every little thing happens for a reason❤️ keep good faith and talk to God in your heart and let him know that you need him and he will help and comfort you ❤️🕊 

Good bye Robert❤️ see you in the after life❤️ today it is you tomorrow it will be the rest of us❤️",1

,,,,"Thank you Robert for sharing your truly heartfelt story and whirlwind if a journey youve been on, I want to know that my thoughts and heart are with you through all of this. I work in healthcare and this has given me an incredible perspective of those who have lost their time with this world. I will carry this with me as I care for every patient who has been dealt the same card, and make their last moments as amazing as possible. No one should ever have to die alone, and thats why we are all here with you. You have inspired me to live my best life possible, and I thank you for that Robert.

I had a dear friend of mine die from cancer at the age of 17, we shared a mutual favorite band, Tool, and the song that got him through it all, was The Patient, if you are still with us, give it a listen, and see if it brings you any peace, I certainly hope it does.

,,,,"Robert, I hope you're still here and I wanted to post here not just to comment but so I can remember your tale, your struggle and lessons. I hope you know that we as a community are here with you if not in person then in our hearts and spirit. I'm not sure what to say but as a Lord of the Rings fan, a quote that resonates best with me in regards to death is the comfort that Gandalf tells Pippin.

PIPPIN: I didn't think it would end this way.

GANDALF: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it.

PIPPIN: What? Gandalf? See what?

GANDALF: White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise.

PIPPIN: Well, that isn't so bad.

GANDALF: No. No, it isn't

I hope you find comfort in the rest of your days and one day when it is my turn to pass, I will see you in that far green country and we can share our tales and lessons we've learned along the way.

Thank you, Robert for sharing your story and lessons. May you rest in peace.",1

Oh, Great Spirit, whose voice I hear in the wind, whose breath gives life to all the world. 

Hear me; I need your strength and wisdom. 

Let me walk in beauty, and make my eyes ever behold the red and purple sunset. 

Make my hands respect the things you have made and my ears sharp to hear your voice. 

Make me wise so that I may understand the things you have taught my people. 

Help me to remain calm and strong in the face of all that comes towards me. 

Let me learn the lessons you have hidden in every leaf and rock. 

Help me seek pure thoughts and act with the intention of helping others. 

Help me find compassion without empathy overwhelming me. 

I seek strength, not to be greater than my brother, but to fight my greatest enemy, Myself. 

Make me always ready to come to you with clean hands and straight eyes. 

So when life fades, as the fading sunset, my spirit may come to you without shame.

,,,,"Holy cow. I haven't been so moved by anything for quite a long time. It seems you've reached what I consider to be the pinnacle of human existence. A complete and utter equanimity amidst an open and boundless awareness of the joy that is our life on this planet. 

It's a tragedy that the vast majority of us only seem to reach this pinnacle when our own mortality is dropped on our heads. Buddhist monks attempt to mimic mortal threat in order to achieve this pinnacle before death is imminent. I wonder how successful any of them ever really are.

What is it about consciousness that can't seem to not take for granted all of the little things that make life sweet? What is it about consciousness that clings to all of the little things that niggle against it? I suppose it's the negativity bias that kept us alive in the brush. Boy, has it backfired. 

I hope that for your last few days, you utterly bask in this golden feeling. For most of us, it's impossible to reach it without standing where you're standing now. Bathe in it, friend. Feed from it greedily 

May your crossing be swift and painless, and may you feel a wholeness with the universe that fills your heart and soul to brimming.

I will remember you, friend. You have helped more people than you can ever know.

I  quit smoking cigarettes in 2018, and quit Vaping the first week of  January this year. I am coming up on one entire year free from the  chains that were keeping me held back.

I really don't have the words to express how I feel about your post, but it was beautiful.

You seem like a beautiful soul as well, regardless of what happened during your lifetime on this earth.

You have made an impact on this world, and that's something that not many people have the chance to say when their time comes.

,,,,"This post came randomly on my feed and I’m not even the type of person to leave any comments on these types of platforms, but I felt compelled when I read this post. I don’t know what the original post says, but this really hit me deeply. I have never cried and ached this much for a complete stranger that I don’t even know what they look like. 

First off, I want to tell you that you are an amazing soul and if I could have any one wish right now, it would for you. I literally had put my phone down to pray for you. I have a few auto immune diseases and heart condition. Although I am doing alright at the moment, I worry about those unpredictable flare ups that could be my last. When I was 17, I was given 6-8 months to live at one point which you would think make me appreciate life so much more. But I was a stupid depressed kid. I am grateful that I still survived to be 34 today. 

I lost the best grandmother to suicide 2 years ago and just this past August, lost my grandfather to cancer. Everything happened to fast. What hurts most is because there was family issues, we did not stay connected until the very end. By that time he was so weak. I still cannot get over that he had left me a beautiful message and picture literally a day before he passed, but I never got it because I had blocked him on that platform. My mom finally saw the messages and sent them to me when she was going through his phone after he passed. Now the guilt of feeling that he thought I was ignoring him when he was trying to reach out to me and just tell me he loves me which has always been difficult for a guy like him. 

I always feel heavy regret in my heart for both my grandparents as there was so much more I feel I could have done. I will never feel peace, because they never left peacefully. It will always hurt and never not because of the details of how and what had happened. 

I can’t I cannot stop crying typing this. Your post is so eye opening. I am deeply moved in many ways. And I want you to know that you are so loved. Even with the shorter lifespan that I already have, if I could take a year out of my life to give to you, Robert S, I would. Why? Because I also know you would treat it so much more precious than me. I now feel the urgency to do better and get out there and do more. 

I have a husband that is amazing and a son that was a miracle baby, yet I take them for granted and let my anxiety get the best of me, so they get the worst of me. They deserve so much better. They deserve someone that gives them as much as they give me. They are my whole world but I realize I need to treat them as such. I need to make it a point to make everlasting memories with them because that’s what will be the best gift I could give them when I’m gone. I just want to say thank you for writing this. It’s honestly one of the most touching things. And I read a LOT of difference things. 

I hope you are comfortable and can smile knowing you really made a difference in this little family. And again, you are SOO loved. I hope you can see it, I hope you can feel it! Sleep tight, Robert. ♥️♥️♥️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",1

She did her best to hide her pain (physical and mental) from me because she didn’t want me to worry. I knew she was in extreme pain and mental anguish, but now after reading your post I can understand her pain much better. So I just wanted to say thank you for sharing everything you did. I know that’s maybe a weird takeaway but I’m very grateful. 

I take so much for granted everyday. And I know I need to change that. I know I need to try harder. I know I need to focus on the things that really matter instead of the things that don’t like money, status, etc. I will make a concerted effort to try harder and change my mentality. So thank you for your kind words of advice on this matter.

The unconditional love must stop along with the end of the disease we call addiction. We have to give our children one last chance, but if you cannot save them ... what is the next step. 
 Nobody will ever know how the outcome will play out. Nobody will ever know if their decisions to shunt their children, due to their use of drugs, was rightnor wrong when the child dies. At that point, you only know one thing..... Grief, times a million!
 I only wish to hug and kiss him again, but realized the time lost was me turningnmy shoulder. Your child does not need to know you will give in. Be tough on the outside, but dont truly lose the love. 
 I always disliked children until I met mine. If he was in pain, like this entry in reddit, I would trade my life for his. 
 Sir, I hope you are still with us. If not, you served your final task in this world. You made us realize that you have taught us until the very end. You are a spot in this huge world, just like all of us. You are doing you far more  than you will ever know.

Death will be gentle when he comes. Some call him cruel, but it is only humans who are cruel; Death is always kind.

Having struggled with depression, your post has definitely made me look at the brighter things. I will try to live my life better.

Your advice on life here means a lot to me, and even though this breaks my heart I'm glad I was able to read your post. I will try to have courage living my life.

,,,,"Dear Robert, dear friend, brother, 

I will remember you. Thousands of people will remember you.

Go on with peace and the courage you have demonstrated. You have shared yourself with the world in all ways possible in the end.

Your life lessons will not be forgotten. They have reached far and wide, to other countries and continents. 

It seems that you have found peace, and for that I am grateful, as we all are here.

I'll think of you till the end. Nobody knows where you're going, whether as you beautifully put it it'll be a nice long siesta or something else.

Whatever it is, know you have a family with you. We will mourn your departure from this world and celebrate the imprint and legacy you have left for it. 
Cosmopolitan in Greek philosophy means, people of the cosmos, in reality, that is primarily what we all are, people of the cosmos, of the world, in that I am your brother, in that, everyone on here feeling for you, thinking of you, everyone here is your family in a way that is true on a foundamental level. 

You are not alone. 

Worry not, for the sufficiency of your letters, take the time and energy to forgive yourself first and foremost, before you pass on. You deserve it, we all make mistakes, the fact you've come to terms with them and in the end wanted to make amends is sufficient, you can forgive yourself now. Truly. 

Whoever reads your letters will, I am sure in their own time forgive you too. 

Your father no matter what has happened between you, already forgives you, and has never stopped loving you.

To your father I say, to be proud, for the courage his son has demonstrated in the end is the most noble and human way to leave this life, and for the depth of the words he shared with the world. Words may last longer than life in the right circumstances, they outlive us, your son's legacy lives on through his words. Forgive yourself also, do not guilt yourself, your son was not alone, he has felt love to the end, and has known in his deepest core that you'd always forgive him in the end, that you'd always love him. 

The last words of Robert, estranged brother from another part of the world, words of wisdom and love will remain with me, with us forever. I thank you, for sharing with us your very being in the end, the thoughts in your mind and the feeling of your soul.

Tout mon amour et ma compassion mon Frère.

,,,,"There is always hope, and if I might share my experiences with cancer I will explain why. I hope you will hear me out. I was diagnosed with gamma delta t-cell hepatosplenic lymphoma about 5 years ago and even through my treatment i found myself smoking. One of the first things to go was my spleen, followed by my bone marrow in a BMT and finally my hips because of the extensive steroids associated with the treatment. Eventually it found its way to my lungs and then something was seen on my heart. If not for the miracle of receiving immunotherapy I probably wouldn't have made it through it, but even with that I cant explain the things I have survived. That immunotherapy almost killed me, it reacted severely with my BMT causing a severe immune response, and right now I am living longer than just about everyone who has this type of cancer (at least that was according to my doctors). After years of addiction, going from cigarettes to alcohol to marijuana and finally abusing the painkillers that were prescribed for my pain I finally hit a true low point in all of it. Since I was abusing my pain meds they became less effective and With my arthritis (from the steroids) the pain in my joints was unbearable. In that bed of pain with no relief I found myself calling to God and in his mercy he gave me the grace to overcome everything. I got off all the pain pills, off of the immune suppressants and steroids and all of my medication. He gave me miracle after miracle and it was there, devoting myself to consuming his word and learning as much as I could about him that I realized he was pulling me through it all. Through those countless weeks spent in the hospital for my treatment, through my loneliness, through not connecting to a single other cancer patient, through my addiction, through my cancer, through the pain. It is where I find myself now and I am so thankful for it. He does miracles friend. There is good news for those who will hear it, with Christ Jesus there is life and healing. He if there for those that will hear his call and He is close to the broken hearted. He has a promise of healing of our brokenness, forgiveness for our sins and eternal life with him. You need only believe on him as God, believe he rose from the dead and paid for your sins. I will be praying for you and your recovery, and that he finds you as well. God bless you.",1

,,,,"I'm having one of the worst weeks in recent memory and am having trouble doing anything I want and just being paralyzed by everything I need to do and even want to do--things I like, love, and am passionate about. My two amazing partners are on the verge of meltdown from their lives outside the house. I'm also in quite a bit of pain after a diagnostic procedure yesterday and having to come to terms with going from my rare kidney disorder ""not causing any major new problems for years"" to ""I may end up having to cath myself multiple times a day for the rest of my life"". I'm only in my late 20's and after the pain of the diagnostic procedure and the pain I've had since, that possibility terrifies me. I don't want to live in this pain for the rest of my life because I'm constantly having to shove a tube into my bladder just to finish peeing so I don't run the risk of an infection going back through my broken valves and destroying what's left of my mostly working 1 kidney and the pretty much dead other one.

...But your post...your post has reached through the fog of misery I've been in today and grabbed both my heart and mind I wasn't expecting. I do have support in my life, ranging from an amazing chosen family to a biological and legal one. I am told I'm intelligent and talented enough to do amazing things, though I have imposter syndrome. But your post reminded me that I have time. I'm not resigned to my feared life situation. Not yet. But just as that isn't certain, neither is my life and exactly how much time I have left. As sad as it is to think about, I have more time than you and I owe it to myself and the people I care about to bring all I have to this life while I'm still in it. And in a weird way, by the time I finished your post, I feel like I owe to you and your memory. Someone I have never met, somewhere unknown on this planet in their home and in their final moments...and I'm thinking about them; wondering how they're doing at each second that passes with each word I type and whether they're sleeping or resting with a piece of technology in front of them that has connected them and spread their legacy to distances and people they don't know. 

Over 20K humans connected to them by one of the most fundamental truths and emotions of humanity: we all must die and love and support for those who must leave us to continue on our journeys in this world with one less soul wandering around with us. It's one of the most amazing things I've seen, Robert. The amount of love, support, and connection and inspiration you've brought about within the last half day on this post alone, despite reviewing your life as wasted, is awesome--with all the weight on the ""awe"". You may have considered much your life not great, but in my very humble opinion, you've lived an incredible last week and there are thousands of people who will carry you with them for the rest of their lives. And some will even pass you down to younger generations when they talk about ""that my [family member] read the final words on Reddit of someone named ""Robert"" who inspired them to pull themselves out of anxiety, depression, and crippled executive function to try and live happily again in one of the worst years of their lives"". With any luck, like a cherished family teddy bear from when an ancestor was young, they'll pass you down too to be a source of inspiration or at least introspection on if they are living their life they way they really want.

I am glad to have the opportunity to be among those people. I've known of you for less than half and hour, but as you stated pretty upfront, we already must say goodbye. Goodbye, Robert. If you are still with us, I hope you're still comfortable. If you're not, then we can take solace in you not having to be in that much pain again.

,,,,"You have mentioned religion and books you have read, but if only I could come and spare some time with you. Should you manage to read this, as I pray you have the time, I hope that I can impart some faith unto you. How I wish I could convince of you God, through my experiences of those of others, but I know that is not the way. For many have claimed to have met God or to have heard a message from him. Faith does not come from me or what I tell you, but from God. 

That's why I come to bring you the message that he did not speak to me, but to the world. There is a Loving God. There truly is. 

The reason for the existence of evil is simple. We are evil. That's a strong assessment truly. But if there was a perfect God, which there is, surely a single imperfection, regardless of severity, would be an insult to him. This is the bad news. We are all evil at heart. None of us have righteousness. We may have done good in our lives, but a criminal in court is not judged by their good deeds, but their evil ones. 

How then is a man to make it to heaven? We are all wicked to the core and unable to clean ourselves. Even if we were to go on ceasing from our wicked ways surely we cannot erase the errors of our past. This is true. We cannot erase the errors of our past. However, someone else can. That loving God can come down and give you a new heart. A new righteousness. A new path to be reconciled with him. No more will that evil which is in your heart past present and future define you. You can wear the righteousness of God and be brought back in as a true son. 

How can God give us a new righteousness if our evil must be punished. For surely as someone in a court must pay for their crimes, surely someone in the court of God must pay for their unrighteousness. Just as in a court someone can pay your bail, God can pay yours as well. This was done through the sacrificing of his own Son, Jesus Christ. For Jesus Christ gave up his heavenly throne and came down to live as a man. Through his years on Earth he was tempted, as are all men, but he never gave in to sin. Because he was righteous, he was able to die, so that his righteousness can be passed on to us. Because Jesus was and is God he rose from the dead, and has promised that all who die believing in him shall also rise from the dead and live him and his Father for eternity. 

There is no promise I can make except that if you accept Jesus Christ as your savior, that he died on the cross for your sins and rose from the dead, that he is truly the living Son of God, that you may inherit eternal life. I pray that you do not dismiss what I have written on the premise that is 'merely' the Christian tale. For surely it has been proclaimed profusely for the last 2000 years, yet hardly I come across people who know it. I know that there may be not much time left, but there is one God. The only way to be reconciled back unto him is through his Son. I pray that you will accept his Son and in turn be accepted unto God as a son of God as well. For the alternative is much to horrible to even wish to think about. I do not promise that Jesus Christ will heal you, but he will save you. Though you will die one day in your earthly body, you will once again have a body provided by God. A body made of heavenly things which will never age, never feel pain, and be perfect in every way. Pray unto God and save your soul. For those who repent and believe in the Son of God will be saved.",1

As I read about the nicotine patch and cigarettes it dawned on me that you’re only 4 years older than my significant other. He smokes. He quit a while ago for a few years, and then started again. We have our first child on the way. He doesn’t have health insurance because it’s too expensive where we live for a small business owner to have. He avoids going to the doctor for regular check ups and only visits urgent care for things like infections. I’m petrified of something happening to him. I’ll be begging him to quit smoking and see a doctor tomorrow. I’ll be sharing your story with him as well. I hope you can have some bearing on his decision.

I'm sad but happy that you're going to pass surrounded by thousands of internet strangers. You've reminded me that life is not just about work. The money in my bank account is not worth missing watching my two sons grow up. It's not worth sacrificing my body. You've reminded me that someday, it'll be my turn to meet death and that I need to leave behind something my boys can be proud of. And to let go of some petty bullshit that is holding me back from actually being happy. I hope you get to read this. Because tonight you saved a life.

Laborers in the Vineyard

20 “For the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of an estate who went out in the morning at dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard. 2 When he had agreed with the laborers for a [a]denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. 3 And he went out about the third hour (9:00 a.m.) and saw others standing idle in the market place; 4 and he said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right (an appropriate wage).’ And they went. 5 He went out about the sixth hour (noon) and the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.), and did the same thing. 6 And about the eleventh hour (5:00 p.m.) he went out and found others standing around, and he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’ 7 They answered him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He told them, ‘You go into the vineyard also.’

8 “When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last [to be hired] and ending with the first [to be hired].’(A) 9 Those who had been hired at the eleventh hour (5:00 p.m.) came and received a denarius each [a day’s wage]. 10 Now when the first [to be hired] came, they thought they would get more; but each of them also received a denarius. 11 When they received it, they protested and grumbled at the owner of the estate, 12 saying, ‘These men who came last worked [only] one hour, and yet you have made them equal [in wages] to us who have carried [most of] the burden and [worked in] the scorching heat of the day.’ 13 But the owner of the estate replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no injustice. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? 14 Take what belongs to you and go, but I choose to give to this last man [hired] the same as I give to you. 15 Am I not lawfully permitted to do what I choose with what is mine? Or is your eye [b]envious because I am generous?’ 16 So those who are last [in this world] shall be first [in the world to come], and those who are first, last.”

We are punished justly, because we’re getting back what we deserve for the things we did, but this man has done nothing wrong.” Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!”

Each of us is worthy of forgiveness and love and life and death.

,,,,"Wow.

I am not sure how this ended up as a blip on my Reddits to read, but somehow I know it was meant to be. Driving tonight, I was exiting the freeway and within seconds before a man about my age (38) was just hit and drug along on his motorcycle by a heavy duty truck. I was only tipped off by a shoe in the road and then came up on a black piece of metal. Barricades, constructions cones all around creating chaos on the roadway. I exited because I had gotten a warning that the freeway was closed up ahead. Once I saw the mental I came to a screeching stop, hoping the vehicles behind me would too. The man still lying on the ground with noone around. No helmet. Running on adrenaline, he asked me the same few questions over and over again. He lived. 

And I come home to read this. It makes me incredibly sad, but I am in awe of life. This post has me speechless. How someone in your situation could have such a beautiful outlook, hopes and wishes for others. I just wish that it wasn't the loss of life that made us realize how special and precious time is.

Socrates said something similar to what you said in his last speech and it is extremely profound. 

""Either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another...Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain...For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this think that any man... even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night.
But if death is the journey to another place...What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again. I myself, too, shall have a wonderful interest in there meeting and conversing with...any other ancient hero who has suffered death through an unjust judgment; and there will be no small pleasure, as I think, in comparing my own sufferings with theirs... Above all, I shall then be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in the next; and I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is not...
Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know of a certainty, that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death... 
Still I have a favour to ask of them. When my sons are grown up, I would ask you, O my friends, to punish them... if they seem to care about riches, or anything, more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something when they are really nothing,—then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about that for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something when they are really nothing. And if you do this, both I and my sons will have received justice at your hands. 

The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways—I to die, and you to live. Which is better God only knows.""",1

,,,,"""Don't look down on death, but welcome it. It too is one of the things required by nature. Like youth and old age. Like growth and maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes at each stage of life, our dissolution is no different.

So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us.""

But if you could tell us one of your favourite moments, or something you did that made you the most proud in life... I would like that.

You're part of the cosmic epic. Atoms in the cycle of emergent consciousness, parts of the universe becoming conscious and experiencing existence.

,,,,"Hello, I found your post on the front page. Know that I will be thinking about you and so will many others. You've taken time to read about the beliefs of the afterlife from different cultures. Have you ever listened to the Bible? Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are the gospels, please start with [Matthew](https://youtu.be/_hBeW2ngRcw?t=100). 

Please take a look at my family's website [here.](https://www.jesussaidwhat.com/) 

John 14:1-6 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.

Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

&#x200B;

John 3:16-18 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 

&#x200B;

Isaiah 55:6-11

Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:

Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.

For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:

So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.",1

,,,,😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️,1
,,,,"Hey my man, I just want to throw in my two cents and say that you are loved, valuable, and worth all of the caring and compassion as the rest of us.

You, deep down, are good people. It's obvious. You have love, and kindness, and forgiveness in your heart. No one can aspire to more than that.

I know this is a bit macabre to bring up, but I too have struggled my whole life with mental health and addiction problems, that were only made worse later in life by PTSD.

I have attempted suicide several times, and while I am (many years later) now grateful that I am still here, I just want you to know that I did succeed once... I was dead. Several minutes from what I was told. While I don't remember it from the outside, I *do* remember it from the inside.

Don't be afraid. While the idea seems scary to almost all of us, the reality of it is not. 

It is absolute peace. Absolute comfort. Absolute tranquility. 

In those brief few minutes, I dwelled endlessly in my happiest moments. I got to relive them for as long and as intensely as I wanted.

I'm not sure if you can relate, but perhaps you know those nights when you lie awake in bed. Praying for sleep. Yet your mind tortures you by looping some insignificant (in the grand scheme) memory that caused you great pain or embarrassment. You lie there, wallowing in your own misery unable to just drift off and let it fade away.

Death is the diametrically opposed counterpart to this. You struggle to stay awake, to stay alive. Afraid to ""fall asleep"". Remembering and reliving all of the wonderful things in life that you don't want to leave... but that is the beautiful part of it.

Once you give in. Once you concede to let go. All of those reasons that you now suddenly realize made life wonderful and amazing just seep into you. They permeate your being.

You get to replay them. You get to experience them again. Every time just as intensely and vividly as they were the first time. You are left in comfortable solitude, in peace, without pain, without anxiety, without sorrow, destined to dance endlessly in the moments that brought joy into your heart while you lived.

I'm so sorry this is the hand you've been dealt. If there were anything in my power that could change it for you, please know that I would stop at nothing to do so.  

If you happen to make it this far into the comments and see this, I hope it brings you a bit of solace. Take it from someone who has been there. Death isn't the end. 

I only glimpsed the beginning of eternity... but it was every bit as incredible and amazing as any religion would have you believe ""heaven"" is. While I still fear leaving those who love and depend on me, I no longer fear death itself. It is but the next step in the greater journey that is as old as time itself.

God speed my friend. I will never forget your story. I will for the rest of my days, carry the name Robert S. in my mind, and in my heart.

Much love my brother. Until we meet again in the churning chaos of infinity and shine new light into the universe as freshly born stars, such that we are all born from the dust of.",1

,,,,"""The day is done, and the darkness

Falls from the wings of Night

As a feather is wafted downward

From an eagle in his flight.

I see the lights of the village

Gleam through the rain and the mist,

And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,

That my soul cannot resist:

A feeling of sadness and longing 

That is not akin to pain

And resembles sorrow only

As the mist resembles the rain. 

Come, read to me some poem 

Some simple and heartfelt lay 

That shall soothe this restless feeling 

And banish the thoughts of day.

Not from the grand old masters,

Not from the bards sublime,

Whose distant footsteps echo

Through the corridors of Time.

For, like strains of martial music,

Their mighty thoughts suggest

Life's endless toil and endeavor,

And tonight I long for rest.

Read from some humbler poet,

Whose songs gushed from his heart

As showers from the clouds of summer,

Or tears from the eyelids start;

Who, through long days of labor,

And nights devoid of ease,

Still heard in his soul the music 

Of wonderful melodies.

Such songs have the power to quiet

The restless pulse of care

And come like the benediction 

That follows after prayer.

Come, read from the treasured volume 

The poem of thy choice 

And lend to the rhyme of the poet

The beauty of thy voice.

And the night shall be filled with music,

And the cares that infest the day

Shall fold their tents like the Arabs

And as silently steal away.""

I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.

The last scud of day holds back for me,
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.

I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.

I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.

You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,
And filter and fibre your blood.

Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,

You would have written a great novel — but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say this post is just as indelible, beautifully written, and meaningful.

I came across your post on r/All and I'm sitting in my living room weeping for you. I'm so incredibly sorry that you've had to go through so much pain, but it brings me hope to see your wisdom, courage, and strength. I hope your remaining time is peaceful and pain-free. 

Your post has given an immeasurable amount of people the strength to do better. You don't ever need to be concerned that you've not left something behind when you go. I've struggled with depression horrifically over the last several years and your post has given me the hope and determination to get help. 

It truly speaks to your character that you worry for all of us in the middle of your own struggle and turmoil. You've left a mark on all of our lives and we'll remember you for the amazing person that you are. Thank you for sharing this with us and we're all here with you.",1

I ran and proceeded to hug those I love around me ! It was a tough day and after reading what you’ve been through I need to understand my life just isn’t that tough .  I’m happy you found your happiness and I’m pained to hear about your situation and still to this day don’t understand why certain things happen to people who have so much left to give. May your heart and soul rest peacefully.  Also to those who can’t seem to be happy with what you have just remember money and status aren’t everything in life . I’ll never own my own home but I have a place to live and people to love and that’s all that matters to me .  I live my life by the day thankful I’m somewhat healthy and given the opportunity to smile and have a good day .  So even if I touched just one persons heart to me it was worth it because I’ve been touched by this and I hope just hope one person has a better day because of it ! Aloha from Hawaii,1

If you are still here, reading these, I just wanted to add a small message of support, and perhaps comfort. I will not pretend in the slightest to understand your situation, but I do believe you have little to fear regarding your worries. I have had family members in uncannily similar situations as yours, and all of them passed peacefully. It sounds like you have good hospice care and that is a massive boon. 


This post is so busy and I hope you are comforted knowing there are many people with you at this end. If traffic slows down I will come back and say some more until Tuesday, but it looks like that won’t be necessary.

I will remember you. I feel like saying ""I"" is extremely impersonal since you don't know me. In my eyes, telling you how much you've impacted ME, and putting a face on that me feels much more empowering and might help you see, explicitly, all the good you have done.

I spend a lot of my time wondering “what would have been if I ..."" Thanks to you, I want to change my approach on how I view my choices and my life. I've been hesitating to reach out to an old friend of mine whom I've hurt by my choices, and thanks to you, I will. I also promise to you and to myself that I will follow your advice and cherish all the time I have on Earth. 

When it comes to death and the afterlife, I am a very anxious person. Seeing you at peace with is coming is very comforting for me, as I have always felt I would feel peace when my time came. This post is apart of your legacy, and the advice you have given will impact all of us in the long run. Be proud of the mark you've left on Earth. In a way, you can even say YOU gave us the gift of life, by helping us understanding how to make the most out of every situation. 

I have no idea what happens when you die, but I have always felt, in a way, that the way your ""spirit stays on Earth"" is not by a direct presence but through the hearts and the minds of the people you have touched. If that is the case, I want you to know you will always have a place in my heart. Thank you for everything, I wish you the best and hope to see you soon my friend.",1

,,,," Hello, Robert. I'm Gordon, 39 year old from Erie Pa. Just sitting up right now watching SNOWFALL and came across your post. You were so personal there's no way I can't at least give you my real name and introduce myself properly. I've copied and pasted your post and have sent it to my personal email. I'm keeping that for the rest of my days, bro. Anyone I know who smokes is getting a copy of your letter. Hell, I might just copy a few dozen and leave them at spots where I see people smoking in my city. Your letter is galvanizing, and I just want to do something to make your words live on, even if its just a little bit. You may not realize it, but what you wrote made some serious waves. You said that you don't think consciousness survives death, and I agree. But I also think that it's impossible to experience non existence, leaving experience as the only possibility. I don't know what's next, but you're wrong bro, it's not over. May you have a peaceful passage to the next journey.  
You made a difference. Peace, Robert.


P.S. 
I know it's random but, if you need a laugh, here's a clip from my favorite comedian Patrice O'neal. No matter how many times I watch it gets me every time. Hopefully you get a smile or two out of it.

From one formerly functional drug addict to another, you need not beg for forgiveness from your friends, family, father or otherwise. You will be forgiven no matter the offense because no matter the severity of damage, at the end of our existence what matters is the love we feel, and if strangers on the internet can love you, for whatever the reason may be, dying or otherwise, god almighty your father WILL forgive you!

Knowing that even for someone who seems to have endured so much more pain in life than I had to deal with until now, the end is a revelation of beauty is just blowing me away right now.

And our spirits shall sorrow no more,

Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

We shall meet on that beautiful shore;

In the sweet by and by,

We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

To our bountiful Father above,

We will offer our tribute of praise

For the glorious gift of His love

And the blessings that hallow our days.

We shall meet on that beautiful shore;

I am truly sorry for what you've had to go through. As an onlooker, it is beyond excruciating so I can only imagine what it's like in your shoes. I'm glad you've lived life as fully as you could though. And despite your many regrets, and wishes for things you would have done, you did live life fully. Maybe not in the ways you imagined you would, but through some means or another you put yourself into the world.

Brother in humanity, the peace you are finding now is the door to the other side of peace. We live here on earth being tested and tested. Sometimes we fail, sometimes we pass. The most important tests are our finals. Whether you struggled on a few tests in the past, you are acing yours now. 

Our lives on earth are like specs in time, perhaps feeling long to us at points, but nothing compared to time. But our lives here don't end when we close our eyes for the last time. 

I am writing to you acknowledging that you said you understand people write to you about religion out of wanting your souls wellbeing. Your soul is ready for everything good that awaits it, so I feel I must share this with you. I hope it can reach you. 

124,000 prophets came to tell us about one singular truth, that there is one Divine Being and that we are all here being tested, and that in the end, we will be judged. Our Judge is the Merciful, the Loving, the Forgiving, the Pardoner, the Protecting Friend. He is all these things and more. He is the God that forgives, and once we are forgiven, our slates are wiped clean. Robert, the new leaf you have turned in this short time is who you have become, pure and kind and full of light. You are not who you were then, you are who you are now. 

This might be the end of the life of tests and trials and tribulations. But it is not the end of everything. It is the beginning. Existence is infinite. Talk to God, as you have. Pray, pour out what is in you, even if you do so in a whisper or silently. He answers the caller who calls upon Him. 

""I am as My servant thinks I am. I am with him when he mentions Me. 

If he mentions Me to himself, I mention him to Myself;

And if he mentions Me in an assembly, I mention him in an assembly greater than it. 

If he draws near to Me a hand's length, I draw near to Him an arm's length. 

And if he comes to Me walking, I come to him running.""

Walk toward God as you are. He will run to you. He is with you always. 

The last of the prophets to tell us of this essential truth--Who placed us here, why we are here, and what comes after this--his name is Muhammad. 

The messages he conveyed to us were simple. The name of the religion, Islam, is simply submission, which is to God. 

We were all born upon our nature, we were much the same as each other and later took different paths. But the original nature of man is exactly what is asked of us by God. Islam is not a foreign idea, but simply acting upon all that is best for us and our nature and wellbeing, keeping in line with what the Creator knows about His creation that we often don't realize without reminders. 

You are restoring yourself to your nature of peace, kindness, love, light. May you enter an eternity of all of the above and more. 

May you be cleansed of any grief left in you at the gates of heaven, and enter into it knowing it is the home you were heading to all along. 

In heaven, people think back on life as if it were a little thing. Once you are in eternity, everything that has passed must be so tiny, however big they felt then, right?

May we all join you in the eternity of peace and bliss. The best part of heaven isn't golden roads or palaces, it is entering into the peace and tranquility we all seek as human beings, knowingly or unknowingly. 

May you enter into your home with peace, my friend. God bless you. I hope we all see one another at the gates. You would have a mini nation of people there to greet you with all the love they sent to you down here.",1

,,,,"Your story and experiences have reignited my love of medicine. I applied to medical school last month and it is hard to keep putting in the work to enter a profession that will be difficult and stressful but I feel that it is my calling. When I see the tremendous impact that a good clinician can have on a person’s life it inspires me to continue to work to enter this career.

You also seem to be kind and I believe that is the greatest thing a person can be, it is easy to look around at all the turmoil that the world is facing and believe that humanity is cruel but people like you keep society together without being featured on the news.

Above all, you are not alone. I will never meet you or know you but I, and many others, are here with you.",1

,,,,"Hi, Robert. I know I’m very late in responding, so you may never see this, but I wanted to write it anyway. Your post touched me incredibly deeply. I’m just coming out of a rough time in my life mentally, one of many I’ve had, and being stuck inside for months thanks to the pandemic hasn’t helped. But your request for us to live our lives to the fullest - I’m going to strive for that, in every way I can. I’m going to help others around me to do the same. No matter what, we’re all going through this crazy world together, and it should bring us together. 

I texted my mom today, for the first time in a while. Our relationship has never really been all that great, pretty distant. But I’m glad I did, just in case. I hope your dad sees this post. You seem like, through everything, you’ve grown into a strong, kind, wonderful person. You’re even using some of the last of your strength to fulfill a promise you made to a bunch of strangers! That was the first thing that struck me about you. If you ever doubt your strength in these last days, please remember that - through this you’ve inspired so many people to start changing their lives, and there is such beauty and meaning and strength in that.

I don’t know what I believe about an afterlife, but if there is one, I think you’ve earned a place in whatever good side lies ahead. If there’s karma, you’ve just earned a lot, and not in the Reddit sense. And if there isn’t? Your life has had meaning, and you will be remembered. I’ll always remember and look back on this, and remember to LIVE. Even though you’re a complete stranger - I’ll carry this advice with me. I promise this. And I know that’s true of so many others, too.

Know that our thoughts and well-wishes are with you. You have pieces of all of us there with you, the same as you have left with us. Many will be praying for you, like you said out of love and concern and care. The rest of us will be remembering and hoping for peace in this last of your time. We may not know you, but you are loved.

Best wishes to you. And thank you.

Personally I think death is just like falling asleep. You can't remember the very moment when you fall asleep. I think death is like that. There is literally \*nothing\* to worry about. And they you wake up as a new being. A human, an animal, somewhere, sometime, and the cycle continues. Death is the same as before you were born. Death is interconnected with all life. Without life, no death, without death, no life.

I came to r/suboxone about to ask a question, and I stumbled onto this post of yours. I appreciate that you took the time to share yourself so honestly. 

At first I just thought to myself that it was so sweet, insightful, and profound, but then you touched on some things that I’ve struggled with all my life. Maybe part of the reason I turned to heroin to deal with it. I related to your words about having the courage to live life the way you see fit, and not to worry so much about what people think, or the money.

I have always felt the external pressure from parents and everyone that’s mindlessly in the rat race. They accept it as normal, and to them it means they’re doing life right. For whatever reason I don’t view life that way. I’ve endured a lot of frustrations relative to the fact that we all die anyway, and yet we devote our time to make somebody else’s life more comfortable. I didn’t know how to live with that conundrum. Not only are you possibly the first person to relate that same sort of sentiment, but you have the ultimate freedom to dismiss it. 

I loved reading this. It is beautiful, touching, and I think it has a bit of something in it for almost anyone to take from it. I hope I can go out as beautifully and helpfully as you have. Thank you. I wish you the best on your way out, and with whatever may come after. I don’t claim to have knowledge of that either. I don’t believe anyone that says they do. You are proof that you can be optimistic about the things people fear and make up tall tales to cope with. I agree you should never say never, but in the end an all knowing-all loving super-being is going to understand. It’s not like this god individual has made it easy! =)

,,,,"Many years ago when my grandfather was on hospice care after a long battle with several types of cancer, I felt his passing. I knew in that exact moment when he left this world which was exactly 4:20am. The very next day as our family sat quietly in his living room looking at pictures and trying to recall memories that we once shared with such a kind and gentle man, we found his tupperware container full of pocket-watches. Among those watches I noticed his favorite one because I've seen him pull it out of his coveralls to carefully open it so many times that it was just burned in memory. I decided to pull his favorite watch out of the container and open it like he once did and was in a bit of shock when I noticed the time. The watch had a bad battery and laid dead on 4:20 which was the time of his passing. I'll never forget this moment. 

We can either let fate lead us through life or we can shape our own destiny. 

Thank You for opening up my heart and to see why living the best life matters the most. I hope your journey to the other side is a pleasant one. I'll never forget what you wrote and will try to carry your message to others. God bless you.",1

I am here as well. I wish I could be with you and physically touch your hand to prove you’re not alone. 

I stumbled upon your beautiful letter and I want you to know how much love you have generated. Please rest and be assured that your Father still adores you. You now have Mothers, Daughters and Sons that love you! 

You have created this massive wave of love from your beautifully written words. You HAVE written your “book!” Just like you said about your having always worked for the ever elusive bits of green paper-I am sure after reading all the comments and accounts of how you have changed people’s lives-you now realize that you did not need a publisher or a book tour to deliver your work. You are more successful than any award winning writer. 
You have authored the most profound message of how we should honor ourselves. To not take things for granted. To forgive. We are all listening.

You sound like the brother I always wanted and may you feel the rush of love that every poster is sending you.",1

""Parable of immortality ( A ship leaves . . . ) by Henry (Jackson) Van Dyke - 1852 - 1933

I am standing by the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength, and I stand and watch until at last she hangs like a peck of white cloud just where the sun and sky come down to mingle with each other.

Then someone at my side says, 'There she goes!' Gone where? Gone from my sight - that is all.

She is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side and just as able to bear her load of living freight to the places of destination. Her diminished size is in me, not in her.

And just at the moment when someone at my side says, 'There she goes! ' , there are other eyes watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout : 'Here she comes!'""

Have a great voyage.",1

“The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.”

John 3:16-17

Yet I wish you well, someone you never knew and thought of, existed with a strange face and stranger thoughts, a light among the billions that wanted you to live more but I wish you don't regret anymore.

Like so many, I haven’t had the easiest life. Between being abused from an early age, bipolar, suicidal, and a workaholic, 2020 has felt like hell.  

And damn, man. I hope you read this, because you’ve helped so many people, including this one pathetic, mess of a human.

,,,,"I'm not a regular Reddit user, but I stumbled upon this post and read entire of it slowly, patiently. 
I didn't get close to what you have experienced, but here's a little thing that I would like to share. 
I'm now living as a grown-up teenager with 'subtle pain' that I've been carrying along all the while, for the past few years since I parted with my first love. And I didn't felt like trying another time, not even in the future. I fully regret for the mistake done but, it's unrecoverable. 
However there are words in my mind which resists me from forgetting about her. 
There's one day, that she asked me: what will you do, if you witnessed an accident and unfortunately she's the victim of the accident, lying on the road?
At that time, we weren't together yet as couples. However, without hesitation, I replied: I would give you a kiss… right before you leave. I wanted to ensure that you are leaving in happiness, you are leaving without fears, without regrets. I would make you write the full stop of your life diary, in the best possible manner, with a warm heart, happy smile. 
This might perhaps couldn't relate much to your situation, but I would like to express my sympathy and would like to support you to stay strong and live till the fullest, till the end. I hope that you can, like what I told my past love, that you will be leaving without regrets, leaving with happiness. 
I'm still young, but I'm already sick imagining about how I'm going to move on for the rest of my life with my current regrets that I've brought to myself. 
I wish you all the best, and I really appreciate for this long yet meaningful post. It really made my day. 
I'm believe that your dad will forgive you. Although almost like you, I've done too many mistakes in life that might perhaps even, refrain myself for asking any more forgiveness. I've used the word sorry too much. And I can't ask for it anymore.",1

I've seen people die of lung cancer literally before my eyes, and still it was ""never the right time"", I was always too stressed, too busy, too depressed to try.

I cant describe the way I've felt reading this, but I'm sitting here in the bathroom at work sobbing my heart out.

Your words are beautiful, and you are a beautiful soul. Im a jaded, angry, pessimistic person. But what you've said has touched me today in a way that I've not felt since I was very young.

Rest well for me my friend. I'll do all you ask, and we can meet up on the other side.

,,,,"Robert, 


   I want you to know that I'm typing this in the 12th hour of my dismal grave yard shift in middle of the world's most unimportant parking lot as a security guard. I have mad many mistakes and failed many times in my life. I have a girlfriend who loves me very much and I am still trying to love her back despite my brains apparent inability to do so. I lost my job dude to being late to many times and now sit here in this part time weekend only gig to just barely pay my bills. I have been using a vape for the last few months after kicking the habit in January and going back a few months later. I tell you this small window into my life so you might understand me when I say you have given me food for thought and touched my life in a way I didn't think possible. I want you to know I will be doing some thinking in this next week and that its because of you that I will quit smoking and will live every day just a little brighter and with more enthusiasm for the opportunity to try again everyday, until my last day. I don't know you and you don't know me but from the bottom of my heart thank you. I hope you are comfortable and that you pass gracefully and I want you to know if anyone is on the other side you should be greeted with outstretched arms full of love and acceptance. I am nearing the end of my shift and will go home to a warm bed and family made of dear friends.

I am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze, and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength, and I stand and watch her until she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come down to meet and mingle with each other. Then someone at my side says: “ There! She's gone!” Gone where? Gone from my slght—that is all. She is just as large in mast and bull and spar as she was when she left my side, and just as able to hear her load of living freight to the place of her destination. Her diminished size is in me. and not in her.

And just at that moment when someone at my side says: "" There! She's gone!” there are other eyes that are watching for her coming; and other voices ready to take up the glad shout: “There she comes!""

And that is—"" dying.""",1

I hope it will help him. Unfortunately we have no insurance so the mental health part is on the back burner till we can afford it. But I'll always fight for him.

your message of hope and inspiration remains readable for a long time to come and i want to personally thank you.

Personally, I have never smoked but a lot of my family did. I saw first hand what cigarettes did to my grandmothers, my grandfathers, my great uncle, my aunt... I could go on.

I go back and forth in what I believe but I really, dearly like to hope that prayer can connect us all to each other in some way that can’t be explained. Tonight, I hope so much that God is as real as I feel he is and that he can be with you when you need him. I hope that your letters get out in time but if they don’t, I hope that you still feel forgiven. I think all these people reaching out to you, regardless of your past or anything you might have done should show you that there is goodness and beauty left in this world and that forgiveness ultimately wins. Although I never knew you, I did love someone deeply who struggled with alcohol addiction and we went through a lot because of it. I know it’s not the same as hearing it from your own loved one but having been in the role of the person being “wronged,” I forgive you. And I forgave him too, a long time ago even if I no longer wanted to speak with him. It’s possible it might be the same for your loved ones too. 

As for the rest of your words, man did the ones about work and overtime hit hard. I have some changes to make and some boundaries to set. I let my job as a teacher become my whole identity and I want you to know I believe in what you have to say and that I’m going to follow your advice. I typically work all Sunday every Sunday. In your honor, I’m going to sleep in, visit with my parents and pets back home, make sure my boyfriend knows how much I still love him despite the arguing we keep getting into lately, text my grandparents, and let the day unfold naturally without any schedule. When I find a moment that is peaceful and beautiful, I will be thinking of you and pray over you in that moment. Thank you for writing what you did, it impacted me. 

I hope that when it gets scariest, that you will be surrounded and filled by peace and love. Despite the love of strangers being far away from you, know you are not alone. Your life and your words are valuable. You are worthy, important, and loved.",1

You have lived to the best of your abilities. You look back now with perfect hindsight so you see the hours lost. Those hours you spent working were still living. You might have inadvertently made someone's life better in a way you never knew.

 The places you missed traveling to in real life are still there. If you are strong enough, spend 15 minutes visiting each online. I'm sure someone would set you up with VR on short notice.

Use your last moments of life not looking back but forward. As for your father's forgiveness, know that as long as you truly hold that feeling of sorrow you had for the wrongs you've committed, all is forgiven. It's the fact that you know what you did and are honestly trying to make amends for no personal gain. That's all a father ever wants from his child. 

Reading this post has made me step back from my little world. Reevaluated my situation as I have been contemplating the problems I've created lately. You've touched my heart with your words and I think it's time for me to press forward. Life can feel long and lonely sometimes but it's actually quite short but full of souls.

You have made a difference in your final hours. Go boldly with your head held high and your hand held by all of us.

,,,,"Dear Robert

I'm sitting at my computer finding I have trouble formulating my thoughts so I hope this doesn't turn into a comment of nonsensical stream of consciousness. I wanted to genuinely express to you that your post moved me and has evoked many emotions. I have saved your post and intend to revisit it many times in the future. I'm a natural worrier and procrastinator and your perspective is invaluable to really showing me and I'm sure people like me, the real scope of the mountainous molehills we create for ourselves. Living for the now and dealing with problems in the moment is something I do and will continue to struggle with for a long time. Your perspective and words of wisdom will no doubt ring in my head for years to come and I hope, might help me gain a better philosophy for life. While there are no doubt many more poignant messages here than mine I wanted to make sure I added my voice to the many that are here to see you off, we're here for as long as you need. I wish you peace and tranquility. You will not be forgotten. You and the words you've given us will remain.

Sincerely, Mister-Blue-Sky",1

,,,,"Hi Robert, I hope you're still here when you read this (what an incredibly strange thing to write). You've moved me to tears with this post. I obviously don't know you but what you said spoke deeply to me and I feel an incredible sense of sympathy for you. You're so eloquent and seem good-hearted. It strikes me as odd that you have no one around you, at least in person, to be by your side. I guess life is indifferent that way and I'm sorry for that.

You have rekindled the urgency for my pursuit of life. I too want to write a novel. I'm making slow progress and should probably move faster. Our time may be cut short and in any case is finite. It is so easy to lose track of how precious every day is when you're lost in the apparent monotony. Thank you for reminding me of the importance and urgency of living your dreams, so incisively.

I'm not sure what to say to you. I feel an immense urge to make you feel alright, to convey a warmth, but I don't know how.

I think that regardless of who you were in the past, you are a good dude now. You were dealt a bad hand, and are taking it in stride, which is all one can do (I am a big subscriber to stoicism).

Robert I will remember you. I will probably think back to this post of yours at certain key junctures in my life. Thank you. If consciousness does endure, then it is probably infinite — that has been my great fear ever since psychedelics took me somewhere deep and dark. If that is the case, I hope it is mostly pleasant. If all ceases, then you will simply be no more. In either case, goodbye,

I love you.

,,,,"If this helps you alleviate some of the guilt that you’ve been harbouring, my dad died of cancer. He never touched cigarette and was in army, exercised daily.
My mom is a cancer survivor, she never smoked, is a pure vegetarian and has always abstained herself from alcohol.
Clearly then, cancer seems like a random phenomenon! 

The sad truth us, many of us will develop cancer whilst being non-addicts.

41 is early, I know. But do not blame your  lifestyle. You only did what gave you happiness then. And I bet it was worth the risk then.

I’m 25, and I’ve very recently started smoking. I do it as a rebellion, exhaling in the face of cancer. Both my parents developed cancer. And I choose to develop cancer on my own terms.",1

Dear Robert, i see in you that person, i'm going to give away a part of me and i hope who will receive it is someone as bright as you.
When i will be prepared for surgery i will think about your words and how much a stranger, sometimes, needs us, needs our words, our care and support more than we can ever imagine.

I lost my father on the 1st of May this year, and my mind has gone back and forth on many a thing since then. I can't help but come to the conclusion that sometimes things happen for a reason.

At least one friend sent this to me, saying it brought him to tears. Saying he thinks he was meant to see your post so he can stop smoking. I feel I was meant to see your post also, to help give some more perspective on the thoughts my father had in his last moments.

Regret, guilt, love, time, loved ones. Life is strange, but you've touched the souls of at least 2 more people, and I pray you find the peace your soul craves.

,,,,Why would you be on Suboxone? Aren’t you in pain and taking good pain medicine which just doesn’t help with pain but also coughing. And suboxone would stop pain meds from being as effective. If you’re in suboxone out of fear of being addicted you shouldn’t be. You’re totally fine to be on good pain meds and in your case the benefits of them way out weigh the dependence from them. Once you get better then for sure get on suboxone but don’t let the negativity around opioids dissuade you from taking them when needed. I know it’s none of my business but that’s how I feel about the subject and I just wanted to maybe help by providing my advice. Again sorry if I’ve over stepped. Get well.,1

Having read his words, I am truly and deeply touched by his (or Robert, your, if you’re reading this) openness, insights, and raw wisdom. 
Here’s what I’d like to have happen, but I’m not sure how to get it done...I’d like to have Morgan Freeman record a reading of this post.  Before you laugh, hear me out...I know we all love to hear Mr Freeman read things (I’d listen to him read the ingredients on a bag of Cheetos) but as I was reading this post, that’s the kind of voice I heard it in.  And I’d like to see this post immortalized somehow.  
So how could we get this done?  Kickstarter?

In his case, they gave him 3 months, he lived for almost a year, but in misery and pain. I guess that’s bad too. 
Because of this, I was my entire life against smoking and drugs in general. I barely drunk. 
Today, due to illnesses, I have to take drugs under prescription. What an irony. 
I learn to live my life every second and I am so happy. I always say if I die today, I think I’ve made every second worth, even with my chronic pain.

Once heard someone quote ""if you cannot explain something simply, you don't know it well enough"". Hearing that changed how I approached education for ever. It has guided my studies ever since and will be something I pass down to my family when I eventually have them. 

Your words left such an impact on me. I wish to live a life of purpose. To leave something behind once my time comes. Reading your words helps to keep me on that quest.

You didn't have the friends and family you needed. It hurts me so much to hear that pain, but it is amazing what we can learn about this life in moments that shatter us completely. 

In the end, when there is nothing left for us to take from this life, we move into the universe again, like the essences and flow of eternity, it is love and peace in death. You have nothing to fear and you have learned so much. 

I love you. And with tears of loss and tears of relief, I imagine your journey now, that goes onto that eternity. You are, in essence, as important as anything that exists in this universe, and your insight provokes avalanches of emotion in all of us.

Do gum, do nicotine patches, do vaping, but don’t go back to cigarettes. It is far easier to quit these auxiliary forms of nicotine. Cigarettes contain chemicals which allow the nicotine to flood your brain faster and exit faster, making you more addicted. I’ve been off them for 6 years. It’s probably hard to think of yourself as a non-smoker. But believe me when I say that although it is difficult it is possible.",16

,,,,"I wish my mother had stopped smoking. I remember her trying many times over the past thirty years but every time something stressful came along or she felt like she needed something for her hands to do, out came the smokes. “I’ll really quit next time” she’d say. 

She never got lung cancer or anything but her weakened lungs were very likely a factor in her developing pneumonia for which she was prescribed a horribly dangerous antibiotic. It was only a 5 day cycle but she developed hallucinations the first day. And they got stronger each day to the point that she couldn’t sleep but she tried to push through the five days. Another side effect of the drug she was on (Levofloxacin) is suicidal ideation. Which wasn’t great for her considering her past with depression but she’d always been very anti suicide after losing her youngest brother to suicide. But on the last day of her 5 day cycle, she walked out into the yard, fed her dogs, and hanged herself from the chain of a swing set. I later found out that hundreds of people with no history of suicidal ideation or attempts had killed them selves while on the same antibiotic and that the manufacturer had decided to stop manufacturing it because despite how dangerous it was, doctors were overprescribing it. Wish I’d known sooner. But there’s also the chance that had she stopped smoking on one of her many attempts, she would have never developed pneumonia in the first place. 

I can’t think of a single good reason to keep smoking. My hat is off to anyone who throws that bullshit right into the garbage and never touches them again.",3

,,,,"Thank you for sharing your moments with us Robert. I’ll be thinking of you. Here is a joke that I love:

3 Nuns are driving a car on their way to Sunday mass when they get in a fatal car accident.  As they open their eyes they see themselves standing before the Pearly Gates in the presence of Saint Peter.

“Welcome, Sisters, to the Kingdom of Heaven,” Peter says, “please get in line,” gesturing to the slowly moving line of souls passing through the Gates.

As the first nun approaches the front of the line, Peters smiles at her and says “you have led a holy life of course, but to pass through this Gate you must be free of sin. I will give you the chance to confess any secret sins you carry now.”

The first nun thinks for a moment and then says to Peter in a timid and quiet voice; “once when I was young a boy asked me to touch his penis, and I did, but I only used one finger.”

“It is good that you told me sister, to be forgiven for this sin, you must dip the offending finger in this pool of holy water and say 5 Our Fathers and 5 Hail Marys.”

As the first nun dips her finger and says her prayers, Saint Peter notices the two nuns behind her have begun to jostle for position in line.

“Sisters! Sisters! What is the meaning of this? You cannot fight in the shadow of the Pearly Gates, the very house of God!” Peter exclaims.

“Sorry Saint Peter, but if I’m going to have to gargle that holy water, it sure as heck isn’t going to be after Sister Mary here sticks her bottom
In it.”",7

I keep reminding myself of everything I can't do, because I have to pace myself so that I don't get worse.

You can do it. I just recently had xrays by a radiation tech that had significant physical disabilities.

I have a hard time reading and writing, which used to be one of my great lives, because of cognitive issues from being sick.

I just picked up the violin last week and decided to start learning.

I'm learning to carve and turn wood, too.

I'm limited, but I'm not finished.

Since I've been sick, I have met so many doctors that should have never gone into the field.

Having a doctor that understood chronic illness would feel like I didn't have to speak, because you would know.

All the countless hours of explaining and advocating and defending symptoms, all gone.

We NEED doctors like you so badly.

I wish you all of the luck.

And if you get that picture I would love to see that painting.

If I ever get to the stage of the violin where it sounds like music and not screaming cats, I think I would like to compose something for Robert.

I think many of us are going to be inspired by his words to create. He just inspired so much introspection into the pain and fear holding us back, and I think he provoked us into stepping out of our safe comfort zones.",40

If you wanted to paint the photo she posted of Robert, it is in the most recent post on his profile. And I think you should read the post, as his nurse also said some things he told her to say before he passed, as well. 

Anyways, I also have chronic health issues that have been flaring up a LOT the last few months due to immense stress (COVID/politics, but also my mother passing away at the end of June amid all the other stress...) and I have also been feeling the way you have. Like I cannot do the things I have always wanted to because of my health concerns. But I need to remember to focus on what I CAN do, rather than what I CANNOT.

It's a crime how difficult it can be to afford quality help for as long as you need it and it's unforgivable how addicts are treated like trouble makers instead of people who need just need compassion and help.

I'm nearly done with my degree, after which I have strongly considered working with people with substance abuse issues.

There's just so much a person can take, sometimes.",4
,,,,"You may not be dying, but please know that you are so, so worthy of love and grace and healing. Limitless and unconditional, no matter what, having nothing to do with faith or creed.",1
,,,,"Would you have a moment to chat, friend? 💙 Like you, I'm an undergraduate student. I put my education on hold 2 years ago due to overwhelming personal and mental health issues. I have felt nothing but guilt and remorse over that decision since then. I have felt lost without school to focus on. I always did well academically and I genuinely enjoyed my classes, but I started to feel pressure from the difficulty of the subjects. I started to doubt my choice of major and question my plans for my future, and my anxiety worsened all of it.

I've felt like I have been drifting from each day to the next, waking up with no goals or aspirations. I've gotten by each day just entertaining myself, occasionally doing productive projects around the house or working online, but overall not moving forward in life. I still can't drive and can't afford a car.

I haven't worked a real job apart from summer work that had employed me for a couple of months. I've made most of my income through online employment. The most progress I made recently was signing up for a winter job for shoveling which while small, I am proud of myself for doing it.

I'm paralyzed by my anxiety and depression. It has held me back in every area of my adult life. I am stunted socially/financially, don't have friends, don't go out, don't have connections. My family life has suffered as well, and my family has become hard to get along with due to my situation and them not understanding it.

This post touched my heart and made me feel a deep sadness and existential realization I have not felt in a very long time. Life is truly short and our time on this Earth to do what we please is not guaranteed. This post awakened something in me, a desperate need to change and make something of my life and not throw it away, including repairing my relationships with loved ones which have become badly damaged. If you could talk it would mean everything at a time when I have nobody to talk to about these topics.",2

Also I wish my Mom would have been able to have this warmness and alertness as Robert. It’s a painful blur of emotions, I’ll probably spend my lifetime trying to find peace with.

Time is our product that is constantly up for auction to the highest bidder and of time we have little to sell, making it all the more precious. 

I wish you nothing but peace in your next journey (or rest), if that is what it shall be.... Thank you.

,,,,Beautiful.,3
,,,,"Thank you. My daughter is ok now. Drugs caused a grand mal seizure with her and she was hospitalized for a while then sent to rehab. Scared her enough she has been clean for 3 years now. But she used for years. She went so far away and was homeless and nothing I said would bring her home. She's been through the wringer, much like Robert.",3
,,,,Thats not helpful for Robert. And never say never. The universe has a way of testing us.,4
,,,,I quit for many years...started again 1 month ago...I'll put the cigs down again for Robert and for me.,39

He wishes he did it for himself before it was too late so you should for you.",4
,,,,"that rules...you can do it. the hardest part is changing habits, the physical cravings go away relatively soon, the habits, for me it was because i'm kind of an introvert and it was something i did while reading, so it let me have my alone time...so i started reading differently, doing things differently. i'd stay inside. i fell off the wagon a couple times, over three months, and each time i threw away the new pack after smoking 2 or 3 of them. the third time, i took one puff and it nearly made me barf. i wish i hadn't wasted all that dough on american spirits but i guess it's worth it to realize i *didn't like smoking anymore*

you GOT THIS. internet rando believes in you, and is proud of you trying to do this difficult thing. you can do it.",2
,,,,I wish we knew the dangers of vaping more... my wife and I vape and it’s better than the alternative but it still scares me how unknown the long term affects are,2
,,,,"just curious, why would you throw away your vape pens?? i mean its not the nicotine that gives you cancer, its the ""smoke"" .. and since vape pens are just ""steam"" , not to mention if you buy like an actual vaping device and not a pre-loaded pen, you can buy the juice and taper yourself off, or even buy juice with no nicotine in it at all, if you still like the hand habitat of smoking or you  work somewhere where the only time you get a break is if you actually a smoker.. But yea im curios as to why you think that vaping is anything at all as dangerous as smoking.. in fact vape pens and a juul, is what has kept me from smoking a single cigarette going on 8 years.. And im some one who tried to quit for 20 years and always failed, until i bought a vape.",2

That's awesome! I started learning last year at age 40. I have many years of piano lessons as a kid under my belt so learning music is not new to me.

I highly recommend watching TwoSet Violin https://youtu.be/pE9aZs1MM64 and joining us at r/lingling40hrs. They are hilarious and the sub is a lot of fun with memes, etc. Definitely compose your piece and post it there when you're ready! Also watch Ray Chen https://youtu.be/cm2tkDtXNJ0 - he was doing a lot of livestreams a few months ago. He's a elite professional violinist and I love that he's made himself so accessible to his fans. He also has a subreddit and discord.

That will make your mind wander in every direction. Then nothing gets done and causes anxiety. Then you get depressed about that.

[ A cardinal is illustrative of a departed loved one and one of the signs of heaven. When you come across one, it might mean they are stopping by. They mostly appear when you miss them or need them the most.

They may also visit for the duration of celebration as well as misery to watch over you and to ensure that you know they are with you always. Cardinals are frequently believed to be spirit signs from heaven mainly because of their bright red color.

When a cardinal shows up at the instant a departed loved one is being talked of or thought of; it could most likely be your loved one trying to make you feel that they are right there with you. ]",1

,,,,"To anyone terrified of facing life without another cigarette or if not able top quit, to be taken from this life too soon like this man Robert, I offer you one piece of advice, after years and years of trying to quit smoking and failing, a friend of mine asked me if i wanted this electronic cig vape thing, which i thought ""ah what the hell, might as well give it a whirl"".. Well i tried it, never had a cigarette since. That was 5years ago.  I know that there is still nicotine in the juice. But i would argue that nicotine isnt the part that gives you cancer from smoking. Besides this, you can taper down in the juice that you buy, they sell e-juice, with lottsa nictotine, all the way down to no nicotine and just juice, and it all ""steams"" the same.. You see, the vape, is just steamed water, with nicotine in it. Thats why you can vape indoors, or anywhere for that matter and it doesnt smell, it instantly disappears because its just steam.. 

Look, dont take my word for it, do some research.. Keep in mind the people that were getting sick from lung probelms a while back, were buying black market juice cut with THC, and more importantly Vitamin E.  Thats what was causing the lungs to fill with fluid apparently.

Anyhoo, i just noticed a bunch of people saying were throwing their cigarettes, its one thing to throw away a pack, but thats not the hard part.. The hard part comes when you can an argument with your significant other, or go tot the bar for some drinks, (the beauty of this is that it actually allows you to keep the ""physical habit"" part) where you  are actually  ""smoking"" something..

If you work in an industry where you can only take a break if you actually smoke, like in a kitchen or restaurant, well, you can still go smoke with the dishwashers, except they will be like ""ques es estos cigaro wey"" lol 

i dunno. Im using a Jul now, which can be charged on your computer as it is no bigger than elongated USB. But there are all sortsa of shapes and sizes..

Anyway this is coming from somebody who wore three nicotine patches, chewed nicotine gum compulsively, and still smoked cigarettes on top of that , so if i can quit, so can you. i just needed some help, and e-cigs, or ""vaping"" is now a viable way to do that. 

I mean look a it like back in the day before they had viagra.. If you had issues, whelp, you just fucking had to suffer. Now you dont. Same with quitting smoking. You dont need to suffer,  and you can stop giving those fucking companies their blood money.

One last thing, while its true that more research needs to be done regarding what the rapid heating of vegetable oil, sugar and water does to its chemistry prior to inhalation into the lungs, using your own common sense, you can tell right away its a magnitude less toxic than ""smoke"".

,,,,Yes yes.  Dco it at your own pace. That is the most important part imo. I know some dr's put you on that shit and then they think they know when is best to start giving you less and causing mad setbacks. I was clean for 6 years but are those Years clean if you're using subs everyday? Idk it's a weird thing. Finally I just tapered off 1mg every month. At the end it gets super psychological.  You don't need 1mg a day to function but your brain demands it.  The last part was the hardest. You can do it as long as you want it! But your doing just fine now doing a controlled amount a day. As long as you aren't chasing a high with it you'll be ok. After the second year I stopped thinking about opiates completely. The thought of trying to get  some now absolutely disgusts me because past me that I finally saw for who she had become disgusts me. I've been around pills and h and no bone in my body was whispering *just do one! You got a sub script anyway* that mentality is so far gone thank God.  This post is a real eye opener. A true addict letter. I hope people truly heard his words as they're saying cos this is so valuable. I wish someone would have said all this to young me. This is stuff they should be showing to high schoolers. Not stupid videos that say weed kills and leads everyone to drug addictions. If I heard real people's stories in high school I think I would have been more cautious. Who knows though. I read this 4 times and cried 4 times. Such a shame when someone turns their life around but its too late to live and enjoy things you missed earlier cos of addiction. A true tragedy because everyone deserves a happy life in the end. After all we only get one. 🤍good luck!,3
,,,,"As someone who tapered off bupe after ten years, don't be a hero. Go slow. 2 mg a month, then even slower when you hit The Wall at 2mg. You have time.

,,,,"go for it...you'll lose the cravings in a couple weeks, i did it after 20 years and it suuuuucked for two weeks and then it was past. the social and habitual stuff is harder to break but you can do it. you just gotta argue with yourself constantly, it'll make you feel crazy but you can do it.",2
,,,,"Yeah. I switched from cigs (a pack a say) to vaping, to nicotine gum / mints. They work well, a lot better than the vape. The only slight issue is calculating your daily intake;",3
,,,,"I wrote this as a reply to another comment here. Thought that it might be useful for you as well:

A little case study, looking back at how I quit. I am not the best writer but I will try to summarise my experience:

- Smoker for 10 years, switched to vaping for one year, and then moved onto mints and nicotine gum.
- Thought that vaping was a good way to quit; but I was wrong, I vaped a lot more than I smoked. The only good thing that came out of that was that I didn’t smell like an ashtray anymore. But then it got bad, really bad, I started having trouble breathing because of the vape, up until a point when I woke up gasping for air. This was one year in but at that point I was scared shitless and threw the vape away, never touched it again. Decided that there is not enough data/research on it and didn’t want to be a test subject any longer.
- That’s when I picked cigarettes back up. Breathing improved but I was feeling miserable. (you don’t actually realise how miserable you are/feel until you quit for at least a week or two when your smell, taste, and stamina start to improve).
- I picked up gum and mints since March (2mg mints and 4mg gum). The ones that did the job for me were the fruity Nicorette mints and flavoured gum - the original ones taste horrible.
- I also tried the patch and the spray but those didn’t work. Not only that I needed the nicotine, but also needed something to replace the act of smoking.

- Most of the information that you find online is true, although it sounds like someone is trying hard to convince you to quit. First few days are difficult, smell improves, taste improves, etc etc, they’re true.
- Depending on your personality, it might take a lot of power of will to do it. Find a reason to do it, find someone to do it for, be scared of the consequences that it could have on your last breaths.
- If you are to take nicotine gum / mints, be ready for a wild ride; it will take you a while to get your nicotine intake right. Sometimes it might be too much or too little, but don’t give up, work on that, it only takes few days. If you really want to do the math, even better, it can be instant.

The best part is that after about a month or so, you won’t want a cigarette anymore. You will want nicotine and will need to decrease your intake slowly, but you won’t “fancy” a cigarette any longer. The smell, taste, and feeling will put you off.

This is my experience, but then again, what worked for me, might not work for you. All I can say is that I tried a lot of things to find something that actually worked.

Just remind yourself that someone cares about you, that you are not weak, that you don’t want to suffer, and that the craving is only temporary. Be as stubborn as you ever was.

Most important!! Set a rule to not touch a cigarette no matter what. Seriously, I can’t stress how important this is - don’t. If you think that “one’s ok” for whatever reason you’ll try to trick yourself into, you’ve failed and have to start the process again.

Oh.. and the best part about this is that you’ll save a ton of money. While a pack here in the UK costs about £10, 105 nicotine gums cost about £13 on Amazon and last you a lot longer.

You can do it.",2

,,,,"I quit smoking ~8 years ago and vaping 6 months ago so am all to familiar.

,,,,"I e-smoked for about two months before going cold turkey on that too. Honestly, I have a girlfriend that said she won’t stay with me if I keep smoking and that was the best motivation I needed. I know that’s not great advice but find someone who loves you enough to get you to quit a bad habit of ten years worked for me.",2
,,,,"I used the e-cigarettes; the JUUL and then the NOVO. I can’t recommend them enough in the cessation of smoking cigarettes and eventually nicotine all together. My journey went like this: JUUL > cigarettes and JUUL > JUUL > NOVO > and then one day I just said “I don’t need this anymore” and I happily put it aside and never thought about it ever again. 

Yes, i started my nicotine addiction with e-cigs but it was also critical in my stopping of nicotine altogether. It worked wonders for me, and I hope it works well for you reading this. 

It’s been about two years now since I smoked my last cigarette, and a year since I ingested any nicotine. You CAN and WILL do it. Find what works best for you and it won’t be nearly as painful or scary as you think, and you will be glad you did.",1

,,,,"Yeah, I can relate to that mindset. It was just one too many times where I ran out of coils, or juice, or went out and forgot my vape. Having to deal with the cravings time and time again I realised I didn't want that to be the rest of my life. 

I also was noticing more and more that my breathing still hadn't fully recovered from before I smoked, I was clearing my throat more than most people, and it felt like I was always running slight cold symptoms.

Thank you though! Not being pushy or anything, it took me years to get to that point, and it had to be my own decision - people telling me to quit would just roll off my back.",2

Meant to stock up on some more juice on Friday, I forgot - have to wait until Monday now.

Personally I came to the conclusion that it's either this or candy - since that's what I defaulted to when I quit smoking the first time - lots and lots of candy. So for me it's picking my poison really, and this poison I enjoy - no real cold symptoms or anything like that; and due to my medical condition my breath will never be at 100% unfortunately.

Update on Robbie from Cherri,6631,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/jv773f/update_on_robbie_from_cherri/,"Good morning. My name is Cherri. I was Robbie's volunteer doula with the hospice program. I am posting here to honor his wishes in providing this message board with an update after his passing. I am not familiar with this app, but Robbie gave me a little tutorial. Please forgive any mistakes :) Robbie had initially wanted to pass while conscious, however, he was having increased difficulty breathing Sunday morning. He received last rites from our chaplain and was sedated with midazolam, at his request, at 3:05 pm. He remained asleep and appeared comfortable. Agonal respirations were noted by the nurse at 6:14 pm and suppressed with morphine. The physician called time of death at 6:27 pm, Sunday, November 15, 2020. Robbie's passing was peaceful and without pain. Robbie spoke often of the kind messages he received on this board. I know they brought him comfort. His final posting was incredibly poignant and moved even our most seasoned staff to tears. He was a quiet man. I think his voice was his words. It was honor to attend to him in his passing. I was attracted to hospice because not everybody breaks a bone, not everybody has heart disease, but everybody dies. It is an honor to be with others as the undergo this universal journey, and it was a particular honor to attend to Robbie, who had no family or friends by his side. I am providing some images on imager that Robbie wanted shared with this board, one of him young and healthy, the other a final handwritten note. Please let me know if the link works:

 http://imgur.com/a/OLbDMdx

I obviously cannot hold onto his phone :) it will be shut off and filed away with his estate, which is being handled by his family, who our social workers were able to locate Sunday evening. They expressed regret at the news of his illness and passing. We are sharing his final posting with them as well. One last thing before I go. First, Robby expressed many concerns about his suboxone. As the opiate epidemic continues to ravage our communities, we see more and more patients entering hospice on suboxone and methadone. I want those of you with opioid maintenance to know that you will never be judged by our staff, and your medications are not a barrier for care. Our organization consults with a pain specialist physician specifically for these cases. We will never let you die in pain. Never! I hope this posting provides some closure for those of you who have been following Robbie's case. These fast cancers are always sad, but Robbie faced his passing with dignity and grace. He was truly a wonderful man, and he lives on in our memories. With regards, Cherri N ",,

,,,,"I read Robbie's post late Saturday night.  I thought about his words all through the night, and into Sunday.  My grandfather, before he died, said something similar to me.  ""The only thing you can never get back is time.""

I've put off a lot of things because of time.  And fear.

Yesterday evening, about an hour before the local Microcenter closed, I drove out and bought a brand new Wacom tablet.  A good one.  I've always wanted to be an artist, and my drawing skills are... well, let's just say they need a lot of improvement.  Getting a tablet is something I've wanted to do for a long time, and I know it's not some magical tool.  It's just something I can use to work with the programs I want to work with.

I bought that hardware because of Robbie's post.  I told the guy at the checkout counter about his post, too.  I just had to share it.  I responded to Robbie's post on Saturday, and his edit to his original was yesterday at 2:30... I have no idea if he read what I wrote, but that's not important.  He was all of a few hours dead when I went to buy the tablet.

I'm just one person that Robbie touched.  There are so very many more.  This is my way of remembering him, of honoring his memory.  He said to follow our dreams, to not waste whatever time we have... so, I am doing just that.

After nearly 40 years, I'm going to become a digital artist.  I'm going to put in the suck-time, until I suck slightly less.

God rest your soul, Robbie.  And bless you, Cherri (my grandmother's name!) for the kindness and empathy you bring to those in your care.",126

,,,,"I hope Robert will find the peace he deserves. Thanks Cherri for what you have done. He really faced death like a warrior who had nothing to fear. I hope I will be as tenacious as he was when the day will come. 

Robert, I will cherish the words you left written for us and I will remember them, as we will remember you.",38
,,,,"I so appreciate this update, Cherri, as well as the comments on suboxone and methadone. It really is a terrifying thought for people in that position. 

Rest in peace, Robert.",32
,,,,"I was hoping to post before your passing but sadly I just missed you. I am having a very difficult time in my life right now and you truly inspired me to make changes that are unhealthy to me. And I am going to continue to do so for you! 

Rest easy friend, pain and suffering free for eternity",25
,,,,"Thank you so much Cherri. I was hoping that Robbie would have someone do an update post on his behalf. I am so glad that his family was able to be located and that they could read his post. As hospice workers, you do incredible work.",23
,,,,"RIP my boy Robert. For the last 48 hours, all I've thought about is him. Rest easy.",23
,,,,This man really will never know the amount of people he reached and the effects he has had on everyone who read his posts. It makes me sad but also makes me happy for him. He will live on. I found his post probably just a few hours before he passed. I have cried off and on about this since. He really touched me in a way I can’t explain here but his words were written for me.,11
,,,,I just read his last post as well and that brought me here. I have not cried so much in a very long time. I love the words.,25
,,,,"Cherri, thank you and your peers for doing the work that you do. End of life care is not something that people want to consider until, often, it's an urgent need and at least to me it's an existential comfort to know that people like you and your peers are doing what you do. 

Robert, I hope you receive the forgiveness in death that you were worried about in life. I hope you have the peace that you were reaching for, and I hope that you died with the knowledge that you yourself provided help to innumerable people that were with you in spirit as you died. Safe journey, man.",22
,,,,"Robbie, I’ve been thinking about you all week.

You’ve shone such an optimistic and graceful light on an otherwise really shit situation.. I’m just so humbled seeing this community band together and lift you up at such a sensitive time. Imagine if we all accessed and felt the comfort of unconditional support like this?  

I’ve felt pretty down on humans lately, but my faith in humans bucket is a lot more full today because of you.

Thank-you Robbie. Rest In Peace and light and love. 
Thanks Cherri.
Thanks sub.",23
,,,,"Here it is 11am and I'm in tears for a man I didn't get to know in person, but got to know through his beautiful, and  eloquent writing. He touched so many people here. Thank you for sharing an update about our dear friend Robert, Cherri. 

May you rest in peace and breathe easy, Robert.",21
,,,,"I started writing a comment on Robbie’s last post and never quite got through it, so I figured I’d finish it now. 

My dad died 2 years ago. I was 23, and he never got to enjoy his retirement. He was sick for as long as I can remember  from heart disease that was some part genetic but largely due to smoking his entire life. My dad was already in his 40s when I was born, but I never knew him as anything other than ill. He didn’t quit smoking until his 3rd heart attack. I’m so very touched by Robert using his last message to encourage more people to quit smoking. I understand how hard an addiction it is to quit, but it is very dear to my heart that he championed that cause literally on his death bed. 

My dad had been on some forms of palliative care and hospice for a couple of years before he died, since he had been on life support and almost passed away at one point before. I helped the best I was able to with all of those things at that time, appointments, cleaning, medicine, someone to talk to, whatever I could do. When the time ultimately came that my dad did pass, he had entered the hospital shortly before and they sent him off to a nursing facility. It was far, the first one that had a bed, and my family was not financial well off. Our only working car had recently broken down so we were relying on rides. All of this to say, my dad was alone when he passed. We saw him as much as we could but when the moment that mattered came, he was alone. Except for the care staff at the facility he was in. This was a man who was loved beyond belief with a caring family and yet he was still alone when he died. 

Since then, I’ve moved states and made a lot of changes and while I always wanted to work in the medical field, I never quite felt like I could do it. My dad being alone when he died, and the guilt I feel from that, has really pushed me to make changes. I’ve since stated working as a nursing assistant at a care facility for those with dementia and other illnesses. I decided that I would do for other people what those who worked at my dad’s facility did for him. In the year I’ve worked at the facility, I’ve held a lot of people’s hands as they died or in the days and hours before the ultimately pass. There is no greater honour than being someone’s comfort in their transition. Thank you for the work you so, Cherri. I’m so happy you were able to give Robert that comfort that he deserved, that we all deserve regardless of our circumstances, regardless of addictions or past choices. I’m so happy that even though Robbie had no family around, he was not alone. And I’m sure he was very loved by someone somewhere even though no one was there at those last moments beside his hospice team. 

All of the nurses, doctors, CNAs, hospice workers, you’re all heros with such a hard job. With all of the caregiver burnout and long shifts and hard days, it can be hard to see through that fog but maybe people like Robert can help us remember why it’s worth it. 

Rest in peace Robbie. Your memory will live on. I know this is something that will go down on Reddit history and every so often someone will remember him and link back to these threads and his memory will live on.",21
,,,,"I am so pleased to hear he was able to pass without pain.  I know myself and others really tried to help reinforce that lack of judgment on hospice and no concerns about treating his pain adequately.  

I am glad he had someone there to be with him and he is at peace.  Thank you for your work.",20
,,,,"I never thought someone like Robbie who would make such a simple post a few days ago would make such a profound impact on my life.

While he always said it was US that cared about him. I think we all seem to forget that it seems that HE cared about us 100x more. 

He might be gone physically, but I will literally never forget this man. The way he told us to let the past go and was so kind and moving with his words inspired me to keep living my best life and not let things ruin it.

We all get one life. And Robbie really reminded me of that. We need to all be happy and live everyday like its our last.

Rest in peace, forever Robbie.",9
,,,,"I lost my boyfriend 7 1/2 years ago (he was 37) to the same type of cancer that Robert had. He only lived 4 months after being diagnosed. My boyfriend never spoke about his cancer the way that Robert did but his words provided me with a perspective that I haven’t had until this moment. Thank you so much Robert for sharing your story. Wherever you are, I hope you’re smiling.

Edit: Cherri, you are a very special soul.",10
,,,,"One of my best friends died of ovarian cancer recently. During her last rounds chemo we wore bracelets that said her name and ""be not afraid"". Reading it here again here in his note hit me hard.",8
,,,,"I was directed to this post from a random thread I visited. It's hit hard for me. 20 years as a polysubstance abuser, few years clean now and still dabbling. I'm looking to quit completely now, because reading this has made me just...I don't know. I'm feeling really kind of empty and a husk right now.

I don't know this man, aside from the several minutes I've spent going through his profile, reading his posts, and reading this update. This will get buried, but I just want to say that it's been enough to light a fire under my ass and I've started looking into mental health and drug counseling.

I hope wherever Robert is now, he's at peace and knowing that he's changing the lives of others around the world. I know he's changing the life of at least one.",9
,,,,Thanks for the update. I really hopes he Rest In Peace and if you remember his last post guys please please please no more cigarettes ! This was so hard and sad for me to watch unfold this week. Goodbye Robbie!,17
,,,,Crying.  Thank God his final moments were peaceful.  Bless you for your dedication to his final breath and posting here,8
,,,,"It's odd.. I mentioned him last night around that time to my wife. He was on my mind.


Been with me all day, wasn't sure why. Then about 645 this evening, I got some rough news from the doctor. Nothing like what Robert was dealing with, but not so good.


He's been with me all night I think. Crazy to think that a person I never met is helping me cope with my own battles..",7
,,,,"I’ve been wondering about him all weekend, since the last post. Thank you so much, Cherri, for updating us. Thank you for doing what you do. I didn’t think we’d hear anything and would have to be content knowing he posted that last message and hoping he saw some of our comments. His words were beautiful. I’m really happy to know his family saw them.",13
,,,,"I knew this was to be expected but I didn’t think it’d be so fast. Robbie eased some of my own anxiety in that I am also on Suboxone and am I’m undergoing tests to find out if I have cancer again and it’s looking very much like I likely do have it. So Robbie’s brave posts provided answers I didn’t know whom to ask about regarding pain management and Suboxone. 

I think many of us feel like we wish we were able to have met him and that more people got to know this wonderful person. I know I do. I won’t forget you Robbie. Thank you for being you.",7
,,,,"Thank you Cherri. I came here knowing the worst must be waiting, but your confirmation is the best way I could have heard the sad news.

Thank you to you and your collages for all you've been able to do for Rob, and also for us - his followers for such a short while. 

Rob was real to me, through his words (and still is!), strong and resolute, with grim determination to try to see things right forcing through. His final handwriting sensitively frames this together with the inexorable physical fragility pulling at him near the end. I aspire to I go with the same courage and dignity he showed in his final days. 

To everyone here, we grieve Robs passing but we grieve together. As we inevitably drift into our differing priorities and ongoing routines, I invite you to take a minute now and then to remember Rob and how the normal boundaries of country, creed, and politics were forgotten by all so we could try to be by his side.

Take care of yourselves and each other, and don't forget to hug the ones you love.",7
,,,,"Rest in Eternal Peace Robbie. 

Thank you for the update Cherri ❤️💔",14
,,,,"Thank you for this update; I’m so moved to know you were able to contact his family and that even though they weren’t able to be there, his words and his love for his father will surely bring them some peace. I cried Saturday reading his final post, and I weep again now. Thank you for your generous spirit that brought you into this line of work and for helping him transition as comfortably as possible. That gift of compassion in a person’s final moments is an immeasurable grace.

Edit: typos due to onion juice in my eyes at time of post.",12

Cherrie, I just know your presence meant a lot to him.  I also feel a sense of relief to hear his family had been found and notified.  I hope Robbie gets the forgiveness of his father he so prayed for!  It's a shame they couldn't have mended their broken relationship while he was alive.  You can be at peace now, Robert.  Your letters to your family WILL be seen by them.  I know how much you expressed your wish they would.  I wish you could tell us what you experienced, what you've seen, and the profound peace with which you're surrounded by.  I never met you, but thank you for your gift of words and your post.  It's made a difference in my life :)  Rest and breathe easy, my friend  <3",5
,,,,"Man. This hit me hard. I’m literally dropping tears in my coffee right now. I know Cherri probably won’t see this, but I’m so grateful that she was there with him while he passed. Hospice workers are truly a gift to this world. The people who came and helped when my dad was dying were some of the most compassionate, kind, understanding people I’ve ever encountered. No doubt Cherri is the same. Thank you Cherri. For your work and your update. Robbie, I hope you’re at peace. 

Now I need to get my act together and get ready to leave for work. I just wanted to express how much gratitude I have for hospice work. Those guys are heroes.",7

And even though I didn’t have the pleasure of chatting with him, I am here crying uncontrollably at the loss of such a precious person. I deal with mental illnesses including depression and I will personally take his words to heart forever. The fact that he passed peacefully and without pain is a privilege in this world and I am so thankful he is not suffering anymore. 

And just like he said, we need to do our best to survive what life brings our way and do it with courage, kindness and love. I personally will not forget his words. And when the darkness comes and I feel life isn’t worth it, I will read his words and remember his legacy 🖤",5

I read all the threads and many comments while bringing tears to my eyes.

She never went to a restaurant to have a meal, she lost out on so many things we take for granted because of her mental status she never received help for until it was too late! I have chronic pain, and went through several surgeries due to a connective tissue disorder that was just diagnosed. I was on methadone for 10 years before this, which helped me to change my whole life for the better! Reading Robbies last words of love and wisdom just goes to show that it is possible for anyone to learn, love, and laugh again in life if you really want it! We always look for support and acceptance, and forgiveness! It’s so important to reach deep down for what these things mean for us!

Its so personal that we were able to be with Robert up until he was medicated and that his passing was so quickly thereafter. For someone who was alone in real life, it felt right to read his story and his plight and to be there with him in virtual reality and in spirit. 

Thank you again, very much.",3

The recent Robbie post had the same effect. Just a real kick in the head. I hope somehow Robbie knows the immense gift he has given all of us through his honesty and love. Rest In Peace, Robbie.",5

I didn't get much sleep last night, but I am happy to be able to have him in my thoughts as he passed. I would love to make a donation to lung cancer research for Robert. Does anyone know which charity is the ""best"" one? There are so many and I have no idea which one to pick.",5

I recently was questioning myself why I didn't go into graphic design since I was so good at CAD in high school. With the recent pandemic, I'm getting so burnt out. After your posts and about living your life the way you want and don't hold back, I have decided I want to go back to school to pursue CAD. Thank you for everything Robert, you are at peace now.",5
,,,,"I read his post and cried like a baby. I dont know why but his words resonated with me so much. I have been feeling so beaten lately. I've always been a go getter all my life. I didn't really have any regrets until recently.  I was still in grad school at the age of 51 when menopause hit and stole my life from me. I barely knew who I was anymore. I suddenly stopped doing all the things I enjoyed and just withdrew into myself. I stopped going to the gym, stopped playing music and stopped riding my motorcycle. I felt depressed and physically fragile. With every passing day I felt more and more old. My vision was noticeably worse, and my hearing, and my knees hurt and I felt slow and out of breath. After reading Robert's message I want to go back to the gym again. In the past,  whenever I felt down or overwhelmed,  the gym was my safe haven. I know that it will be again. Because of Robert I will go back and try again. I'll try to find some strength,  some agility and some enthusiasm for life again. I owe him that much. Thank you Robert,  and rest in peace friend. You touched so many people's lives in such a positive and real way.",5

I read his last post again, bringing me into tears again. Lucky me I checked his profile and saw this update by Cherri. 
I'm sure I'm not the only one that has cried after reading all of these words. I'm surprised how we can feel such pain, empathy and sadness for a stranger that we never met in person, only his words...
Robert, wherever you are, just want to tell you I greatly appreciate your words, your knowledge and your lessons. 
You moved me and many others deeply, and you have influenced (even if it's a tiny bit) ourselves, to see life with better eyes, even if it's only for today.

I just wished that people like you, wouldn't have to go through this moment alone. Many of us would be gladly willing to sit next to you, and if not in person online, through a videocall or a normal call. 
Human connection doesn't require of months of years of bonding, it sometimes happens in the most unexpected times.

I wish you well, I don't believe in life after death, but it makes me feel better imagining you are at the other side of the screen, so you can read all of our words. 

Gracias Robert. Estés donde estés, quiero que sepas que me has hecho sentir tan humana...quiero que sepas que hubiera sido un placer conocerte y sentarme a tomar un café y simplemente hablar contigo.",2

I could tell that more than anything he had wished to continue living, pain free, with his new found outlook on life but he also understood that a such thing was not possible and so he shared what energies he did have with others.

,,,,"My dear, you are not alone. 4 miscarriages here, which lead to blood work dx of two blood clotting disorders. I'm the first in my family to be dx, then my mom then her mom and we assume her mother with multiple blood clots, as well. I feel like those little ones lead us to something we needed to know. We all take aspirin every day, I had to take lovenox injection 1x daily then Heparin 2x daily when I got pregnant again to have a successful delivery. 

My point? Every life matters, they were here, they meant something, there was a reason. I believe it to my core. While this is a pain like no other, share it with others. Do not allow this to box you in. Share the weight. You will feel lighter eventually.

My thoughts are you with you!",36
,,,,I too suffered multiple miscarriages!  I hope you feel better soon and find the courage to keep going and keep trying if that’s what you want!  I had successful fertility babies and it’s a long arduous road!!!   Keep the faith!  Much love to you.,41

You will never forget what you are going through right now, but it won't always be so raw, it will ease, and you will find joy again. Sending you so much love.",18

I pushed for blood work to get to the bottom of why I had two miscarriages and discovered some gene mutations that lead to an increased risk of clotting. I recommend asking for testing now, if you haven't had it already. Good luck!",2
,,,,"I'm so sorry.  I suffered from two miscarriages, so I know how heartbreaking they can be.  Be extra kind to yourself.  If you can talk to your partner and let him know how difficult it is for you because it probably is difficult for him too.  Talk about it because feelings will just build up internally  I know I was shocked at how other people viewed my miscarriages and I received very little support from friends and family.  Hopefully, it was just my friends and family.",3

I'm glad Robbie's words reached your heart like they did so many others here, myself included. I just wanted to offer my compassion and my shoulder should you ever wish to talk to someone. About it, or anything.

Just because I am compulsively ""helpful"" I want to ask if you have been tested for blood clotting disorders, like MTHFR and Factor V, among others?

,,,,"I was fortunate enough to just up and walk away from cigs just over 2 years ago. Very mild withdrawal symptoms, the occasional nosebleed here and there, little more than mild cravings which I could swat away with relative ease, Etc. I'm not delusional however... I was incredibly lucky and I've known since the day I walked away from the habit that if I ever got into it again, I might never be able to break it off. Robert's words served to reinforce my determination. Mostly though, it was his reflection on how he lived his life and what he wished he could've done that have hard the hardest impact on me. I've saved that handwritten note on my desktop as something to both remind me of this great man and propel me toward living my dreams. RIP Robert.",34
,,,,"I’m up to hour 28.
I hate my husband and i’m cold and I keep wanting to walk to my back porch except there’s no pack and no lighter and no ashtray.  I have a tiny vape that is too small for me to break in my fist and a backup in case this one gets lost/dropped/thrown at my husbands head because he won’t do the fucking dishes.

My allergies are 50% better, and I am snide about it because there’s no way that one day without cigarettes did that.  

My skin is dry and my video game is annoying, and I bet by tomorrow I’ll hate way more stuff than I do right now.

....that’s all i got, now i need to go buy moisturizer that will doubtless make me colder and might cause a divorce.

**UPDATE:**

Hour 51.
Have not thrown vape yet.   Still cold, still want to walk out back and draw on something that isn’t there.  Reminded husband that he has literally not cleaned a toilet in 3 years and that I can’t paint because he spies on me.  

No coughing yet, and that’s annoying because at least then I’d feel like i was accomplishing something.  My allergies are still better.  I’m still cold. I’m still tired.   I can’t think of anything fun to do.

My contractor asked for $60,000 by the end of the week and I don’t even care because I’m thirsty.  

Smoking is like going on a ski trip where there are no lifts to get you to the top of the mountain.  The cost of doing it is that you have to drudge yourself, miserable and bored (*so fucking bored**) and uncomfortable, back to where you started. Uphill. In bad shoes.

**2nd Update**
Hour 80-ish.  I’ve lost count.

,,,,"This is a message for everyone here who really wants to quit and for Robbie. Maybe even a little case study - looking back at how I quit. I am not the best writer but I will try to summarise my experience:

- Smoker for 10 years, switched to vaping for one year, and then moved onto mints and nicotine gum.
- Thought that vaping was a good way to quit; but I was wrong, I vaped a lot more than I smoked. The only good thing that came out of that was that I didn’t smell like an ashtray anymore. But then it got bad, really bad, I started having trouble breathing because of the vape, up until a point when I woke up gasping for air. This was one year in but at that point I was scared shitless and threw the vape away, never touched it again. Decided that there is not enough data/research on it and didn’t want to be a test subject any longer.
- That’s when I picked cigarettes back up. Breathing improved but I was feeling miserable. (you don’t actually realise how miserable you are/feel until you quit for at least a week or two when your smell, taste, and stamina start to improve).
- I picked up gum and mints since March (2mg mints and 4mg gum). The ones that did the job for me were the fruity Nicorette mints and flavoured gum - the original ones taste horrible.
- I also tried the patch and the spray but those didn’t work. Not only that I needed the nicotine, but also needed something to replace the act of smoking.

- Most of the information that you find online is true, although it sounds like someone is trying hard to convince you to quit. First few days are difficult, smell improves, taste improves, etc etc, they’re true.
- Depending on your personality, it might take a lot of power of will to do it. Find a reason to do it, find someone to do it for, be scared of the consequences that it could have on your last breaths.
- If you are to take nicotine gum / mints, be ready for a wild ride; it will take you a while to get your nicotine intake right. Sometimes it might be too much or too little, but don’t give up, work on that, it only takes few days. If you really want to do the math, even better, it can be instant.

The best part is that after about a month or so, you won’t want a cigarette anymore. You will want nicotine and will need to decrease your intake slowly, but you won’t “fancy” a cigarette any longer. The smell, taste, and feeling will put you off.

This is my experience, but then again, what worked for me, might not work for you. All I can say is that I tried a lot of things to find something that actually worked.

Just remind yourself that someone cares about you, that you are not weak, that you don’t want to suffer, and that the craving is only temporary. Be as stubborn as you ever was.

Most important!! Set a rule to not touch a cigarette no matter what. Seriously, I can’t stress how important this is - don’t. If you think that “one’s ok” for whatever reason you’ll try to trick yourself into, you’ve failed and have to start the process again.

Oh.. and the best part about this is that you’ll save a ton of money. While a pack here in the UK costs about £10, 105 nicotine gums cost about £13 on Amazon and last you a lot longer.

You can do it.",21

,,,,"Suboxone isn't causing deaths - it is saving lives. It is a medication to treat opioid use disorder. There is a lot of stigma around Suboxone because people aren't educated about it. They see it as ""a drug replacing a drug"" rather than a drug treating a chronic, progressive and (without treatment) fatal medical illness (substance use disorder). That is a larger societal issue that we all need to tackle; we need to challenge individuals in the moment when they talk about people with substance use disorders like they are sub-human. 

Are there people who misuse Suboxone? Absolutely. I would rather them attempt to misuse that than IV fentanyl (I'm not sure how much fun they will have with the Suboxone, again it's only a partial opioid). Most often, people are buying illicit Suboxone because they are trying to get off of opioids and can't find a Suboxone provider. As the MD above said - everyone should get their XDEA.",4

I’m babysitting my sister and she thinks she needs to go to the ER for her period and idk,5926,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1eyzp4t/im_babysitting_my_sister_and_she_thinks_she_needs/,"
Okay so I (19M) am babysitting my little sister (15F) while our parents are on a trip internationally. It’s like a completely different time zone and the signal sucks, they get home in like 6 days. But we are both pretty self sufficient and felt like it would be fine and my parents left us food and money and stuff. We’ve been Gucci for a whole week so far. 
Anyway this morning she got her period while we were just like sitting playing video games and she got blood all over the couch so I paused the game while she took care of it and put on a tampad and didn’t make a big deal of it. I was trying to be nice because I know it can make girls cranky and it hurts and stuff, so I got snacks and a blanket and whatever and we kept playing. Well like maybe 40 minutes later she freaked out because she bled on the couch again and I’m like did you put the thing on wrong or what? So she changed again and I even helped her clean the blood off the couch this time and I figured she’d use a bigger feminine thing. Nbd. Well like 30 minutes after we start playing again she pauses and goes to the bathroom and I hear her scream so I run over there thinking there’s a spider or something but she came out holding like this…chunk. It was like a chunk of blood. But looking at it I’m like shit maybe that’s an organ? Like is that your kidney? But she was like no it’s a clot. And she was freaking out about it. Which yeah it was gross. It was like the size of a hacky sack. So I’m like okay well go flush your clot. Anyway she cleans herself up but then she said she doesn’t want to play anymore and I’m like ok. So she spent an hour on the couch with her face all scrunched up doing yoga breathing and telling me her cramps were the worst ever, so I gave her Tylenol but she wouldn’t take it because she said she feels like she’s gonna throw up. I brought her water and juice and warmed up that gel thing you stick on your stomach you know? So I was trying to help. Well then she says “oh no” and she gets up and goes to the bathroom and as she’s walking she’s got like blood going down her leg. She yelled for me from the bathroom and I go in there and she’s sitting there and I hear this plopping sound and there’s more of those chunks. Like maybe 2 of them? And she says “I think we need to go to the ER”. I’m like why? And she tells me this is more blood than she’s ever had and she doesn’t feel good. But periods are supposed to suck right? And she wouldn’t take the Tylenol either so she didn’t really try to manage it at home. So then she started yelling at me telling me I have to take her because she can’t drive but I’m pretty sure our parents will kill me if I take her to the ER for her period? Is that a thing? She’s sitting in the shower now because she said she thought the warm water would feel good and she was sick of bleeding on stuff and it’s more comfortable than the toilet. I asked her if she just needs a bigger tampad and she told me to stfu so she’s not even communicating with me at this point. I’ve asked her a few times if she’s okay in there and she tells me “I’m bleeding out Mason what do you think?” So like she’s not unconscious. 
Idk, I don’t know anything about this but I also know she hates blood and flips out about any minor cut too. Is going to the ER because of a period a thing? Can you bleed too much? I thought there was only a certain amount of blood in the vagina every month. I feel like she’d be more comfortable at home anyway if she’d just take the Tylenol. Idk what to do. My sister is like average teenage girl height, pretty skinny because shes a ballerina and doesn’t eat meat. She takes accutain for her pimples. I’m not sure if there’s other stuff that’s important? She’s had her period for like a year now I’m pretty sure? Maybe more. She takes flintstone gummy vitamins sometimes, like the ones in the purple jar. And she’s obsessed with Celsius energy drinks. She wears contacts and she had her wisdom teeth removed two months ago. 

Idk I want her to be okay and stuff but I’m not sure the ER is a good choice? Help?

Update: 
Alright so I guess I was posting updates in the comments but it’s better here? Anyway so. 
My sister is okay. She had some scans that were all fine and they don’t think she has fiberoids or tumors or anything like that. She’s feeling a little better but still staying here at least another day. Our mom and dad are flying home tomorrow now. My mom was pissed I texted her instead of calling at first lol. 

Already had someone try to find me on insta so like if you know me or her no you don’t lol. She doesn’t want this going around school or whatever so don’t dox us for at least 3 years lol. Shes cool with me updating though without her name or whatever. 

Also our parents don’t know about this either idk I feel like we should wait until it’s been a few years to tell them too so they don’t kill me lol. She’s gonna hold this shit over my head forever lol. 
Anyway they think she has a blood disorder that makes her not clot right. I’m not 100% sure how it works because she had big clots? But they said they’re pretty sure that’s what’s going on because her PTT took longer than normal to clot. They’re waiting on von wildabrand (sp?) testing to come back but they think she has type 2 probably. Gonna Google that tonight bc idk what that is and I’ve never heard of it so I guess if any of the doctors know what that is or if this sounds like it lmk. 

Yeah wasn’t expecting this to blow up like this lol. I thought this was just like doctors answering questions like a help line. But my sister said thank you for everyone telling me to take her and she’s okay. 


Update again: 
They confirmed it’s Von Willdebrans (idk if I’ll ever spell that right) anyway it’s genetic I guess so they want me to get tested too but like obviously I’ve never had periods and I’ve never had surgery so it wouldn’t be as obvious. There’s still more testing ig, like more specific to the type. But anyway- sister is good and we have an answer. She’s gonna talk to a hematologist next week about what that means and stuff. 

New update: 
So ig I also have Von Willebrands. So does our mom. Ive always bruised a lot and got super bad nose bleeds but like I was also a dumbass kid/teen who thought life was an audition for Jackass so I didn’t think it was weird lol. Anyway we’re all about to be real familiar with hematology and my mom is pissed she’s been told some women just bleed more her whole life lol. Guess my mom and sister weren’t just exaggerating when they would say they were bleeding out. So yeah ig if you’re a girl reading this and you bleed as much as my sister you should see a doctor. Hopefully no one gets gaslit like my mom did but yeah. Here’s a public apology for being ignorant on what yall actually go through bc I thought you could only bleed so much a month 💀 fully willing to admit how fucking stupid that was lol. ",,

I have a question though. They put a tube where she pees. I didn’t watch or anything but is it normal to do that? After the ultrasound they said the doctor would come back and let us know some stuff",931
,,,,"If she’s soaking through multiple pads in an hour and is feeling woozy/lightheaded, etc. ER is the right call. I saw you ask about Peds department vs. adult - she’s 15. She’ll be sent to the Peds ER anyway if the local hospital has a department. A children’s hospital works too. She should be seen particularly with the lightheadedness in the context heavy bleeding. 

For heavy menstrual bleeding - NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (advil) can actually help reduce bleeding and might be able to help while also reducing the pain somewhat. 

If she’s sexually active there is a chance this something else though, such as a miscarriage. I’ll have the ER ask her this as this is none of my business since I am not the doctor taking care of her. That being said don’t be blindsided if the ER asks her questions about her sexual health. 

Call your parents. They need to know what’s happening and they need to get the insurance info to best help out.",880
,,,,"Okay she’s throwing some extra clothes and shit in a bag. I’m trying to think what my mom would do so I brought water bottles, sunscreen, and snacks. And something to do. 
My sister asked why I changed my mind and I told her about this and she said “I told you so” and called me a dick which like okay fair. I didn’t know it was actually an emergency. So I guess I’ll update when we find out what’s wrong",1613
,,,,Alright her vitals now are 101/65 and 80. So better. Also apparently the nurse only asked my blood type because she thought I looked like I was gonna faint watching them do shit with my sister and she was trying to distract me lol. I was over here thinking I was gonna have to donate blood to save her or sum.,662
,,,,Okay we got here. She threw up a couple times in the car but she said she’s good now. We walked in and she was like dripping down her leg again and they saw that at the desk and maybe how fucking freaked I looked lol and took her back pretty much right away. So they stuck a needle in her with a tube on it basically right away and took vitals and stuff and a bunch of tubes of blood. Idk what these numbers mean but it was BP 79/53 and Pulse 133. She told the nurse she wants me here so I’m here. I texted my mom. We left the sunscreen in the car and my sister said I’m a dumbass for packing it lol. Idk man these fluorescent lights are p bright,1557
,,,,"I literally just cried and laughed my way through this amazing thread. You give me hope. You are a good brother and person, and despite not getting it at first,  you did research and apologized and fixed it. And remembered sunscreen ;) seriously you give me hope ♡ pls update us!!",591

As for your sister, I’d get her to ED. I’m not a doctor but strongly advise she’s reviewed by one, especially considering her age and how sudden this is. Also, you mentioned she doesn’t eat red meat but takes supplements, therefore she’s at risk of anaemia if she’s bleeding heavily. Reassure her that in ED they may arrange for blood tests, an abdominal assessment with +/- a pelvic floor assessment, and imaging. 

Keep us updated please. All the best.",416

,,,,You’ve done a good job kid you’re a good big brother,120
,,,,You should allow the doctors to order the tests and imaging they think is necessary to work up her anemia. They probably asked what blood type you were because you might be able to donate blood to her if you have the same blood type. Would be better than a stranger’s B+ blood because you’re siblings so much decreased risk of any transfusion reaction. But if you don’t know your blood type then just tell them that.,218
,,,,"You're doing awesome. What an amazing sibling you are. Make sure you take care of yourself, too, while you're camped out there - get something to eat, stand up and stretch/walk around now and then. 

(NAD.) The abdominal CT is a much better (more detailed) image than the ultrasound and it will cover a bigger area. The ultrasound was probably pelvic (taken from outside) or vaginal (taken from inside), so it's looking at the uterus, tubes and ovaries for things that may have caused heavy bleeding - like a cyst in the ovary that ruptured (basically, a big fluid-y bubble that can burst ). Since it sounds like they didn't find any of the usual suspects via ultrasound, they're going to look at the abdominal cavity (the ""stomach area"", but it's filled with a LOT: stomach, intestines, liver, etc) for less-usual suspects. Sometimes, women can get tissue that travels outside of the uterus, but still tries to shed monthly - it can be painful and cause really heavy bleeding (it's called endometriosis). So that might be something they're looking for. If there are things that they're explaining to you or tests/meds they're telling you about, don't hesitate to just say - ""Could you explain that to me? I've never heard of it before and I want to pass on the right info to our parents."" You might feel more comfortable asking one of the nurses your sister is entertaining so well. ;) 

She's in good hands, between the doctors who decided to keep her and get her stable and the brother who got her there - with sunscreen! because skin cancer is for reals. Sending all the good thoughts your way that it's nothing huge and that she's feeling better soon. If nothing else - you have a story to trade on forever: ""Remember that time I totally saved your life and brought you to the hospital - with a Squishmellow?!"" :)",91

Something like this happened to a family member, only *she* refused to go be seen. She went to go in the shower an collapesed.

,,,,"I’m really glad you brought her in.

Honestly dude, bleeding too much can be a sign of a variety of symptoms that can be serious or not. I really just hope it’s a really bad period, but who knows.

In my late 30’s I was finally diagnosed with fibroids and it was because in my early 30’s I had my first period just like this. It took over 5 years to finally be taken seriously and it investigated properly.

Periods happen, but abnormal periods are rarer. As much as you don’t want to overreact, under-reacting can be much worse. 

TBF, I also chuckled reading ‘tampad’, but I know you’re a 19YO male. I don’t expect you to be well versed in OB/GYN things. 

Your parents should understand that this was a good call to bring her to the hospital. This way she will also be monitored, and given fluids because she can dehydrate really quickly and that can also cause issues. It’s better to get checked out and have it be nothing, than ignore a potentially serious or life threatening condition.",8
,,,,Have to admit tampad had me rolling too,8

Great job big brother.",9

She may have a burst cyst (which is an emergency) ovarian torsion (also an emergency) or endometriosis (not an emergency but more painful than childbirth). She is in the right place now. Yes periods suck but not this much. This isn’t normal, so you did the right thing and you’re a good big brother.",7
,,,,"Also to add, let her make fun of your for the Tampad remark. You’re not really expected to be a period expert at 19. But it sounds like you’re an expert at being a great big brother.",7
,,,,"I’m not sure if I saw anyone else mention this, but this story is almost exactly how my wife (eventually) found out she has endometriosis. 

It’s not been the most well understood condition (even in the medical community), but it might be something to keep in mind and research later. 

It’s becoming more well known as a condition but still not researched enough, and ways to deal with it have mixed results. One common approach seems to be being on nonstop birth control pills to suppress your period completely (normally you take the pill between your periods, and some of them have fake pills to take during your period, mainly just so you don’t get out of the habit).",8
,,,,"Hey OP, it's a scary situation for you two to face but we're all proud of you for taking such initiative. :)

Despite the US coming up normal it could still be something unusual and there are several conditions that can cause abnormal bleeding. Could be cysts (PCOS), could be endometriosis, could even be an iron deficiency. But others have given much better answers (this is askdocs after all).",12

,,,,NAD but I'm honestly a little bit pissed that you went to online strangers to ask for advice rather than believe your sister about HER OWN BODY.,-7
,,,,"Only a paramedic, but her hemoglobin is low (normal should be 12-15 for her age and gender). That combined with her heart rate and blood pressure you reported earlier is concerning. She absolutely needed to go to the ER for this, good job making it happen. 

The tube is a catheter. I suspect that's a clear indication that they expect to admit her and/or don't believe it's safe for her to walk. The ultrasound is to see what the underlying cause of the bleeding is. Her doctor will likely let you know what to expect soon, she's emergent enough that they'll keep a closer eye on her than they would for a patient that had less critical issues.",710
,,,,The tube sounds like a catheter. They may want a clean urine sample. The excessive bleeding can contaminate a urine sample and affect certain test results.,316
,,,,"So, Hemoglobin is a part of your blood that helps carry oxygen around your body.


""Normal hemoglobin levels are different for men and women. ...For women, a normal level ranges between 12.3 gm/dL and 15.3 gm/dL. ...For women, a severe low hemoglobin level is 12 gm/dL.""

You’re a great big bro.",38
,,,,Were rooting for you both,29
,,,,Holy crap a hemoglobin of 6.8 will probably buy her a blood transfusion. You did the right thing for sure by bringing her. No question,21
,,,,It’s a urine catheter. She won’t have to get up to pee. Likely to spend the night there if they put a catheter in,26
,,,,Thanks for the update. Hope she starts feeling better soon.,12
,,,,"As others have said, its a urinary catheter. Just wanted to add that these are often used to monitor fluid balance. Her BP on arrival sounded pretty low and she has lost blood, so it would make sense to me to aim for accurate data for fluid in vs fluid out. (Blood transfusion counts as fluid in). 

I'm a junior doctor in the UK but have been off sick for a while due to my own health issues. Hope my memory is roughly accurate! Also I totally didn't realise you weren't a big sister when I first read your post. You've done so great! I cannot imagine my big brother managing is this scenario  when we were teens 😅",10

I know it must have been scary but you did the absolute right thing and she is in the place she needs for be in right now. 

Please don’t forget to care for yourself. Get something to eat, maybe call a friend.",6
,,,,That tube is a catheter to help monitor her urine output given that her hemoglobin was low. They will likely recommend a blood transfusion given how low her blood counts are. You did the right thing and she is safe and in the right place. I would call your mom (instead of texting) so she is aware of what is happening.,11
,,,,"NAD and totally anecdotal, but I’ve had very low hemoglobin after blood loss (bleed during delivery). If they offer her a blood transfusion, suggest she take it! Or ask for one! It will feel life changing. She may feel restored, which can be incredibly helpful in a hospital setting. She may be struggling with consciousness and memory now. Blood helps!",4

If she was left to bleed overnight, she could have easily died. If her Hgb got much lower she literally would not have the ability to get oxygen to her heart and organs.",3
,,,,"Hemoglobin was 6.8. Holy shit!  That is way below normal.

You definitely get a hero-bro shirt for taking her seriously.",4
,,,,"Adding to this, because questions about her sexual history and habits are definitely going to be asked, Big Bro, make it clear to her that if she wants you to leave,  you will.  If she wants you to stay, I would make it clear to her that you're not going to snitch on her about anything she says.  If it's something that needs to be brought up to your parents,  the docs can do that.  It's not your job to tell your parents her answers.  If you can't make her that promise, tell her you can't be in the room.",765
,,,,"Thank you for mentioning this! I immediately thought that this sounds like a miscarriage. Severe cramps combined with this amount of bleeding screams miscarriage to me. Of course there can be other causes, but end of the day she 100% needs to be seen. OP it’s understandable you don’t have a lot of experience with periods and don’t know what to do, so please listen to the person who does have some experience with periods. They are the ones who can tell you if something is abnormal for them or not. Even if she “freaks out” about blood regularly, I highly doubt your sister wants to go sit in the ER for hours bleeding instead of staying at home playing video games with you or comfortable in her own bed. If she says she needs to go to the ER, she most likely does. 

Good on you for helping your sister though, you’re clearly trying to take the best care of her you can. For future reference, if you’re unsure if something is a medical emergency or not, you could try looking up if her regular doctor has an after-hours number for urgent matters, they might be able to answer questions for you. Also many hospitals have nurses lines that can answer questions and advise you if you should seek immediate care. Alternatively there are urgent care centers in many areas that can see people at all hours, and if they receive a patient they cannot treat in house, they will tell you to go to the ER. 

Now get her to the hospital, I hope she’s okay!! ❤️",95
,,,,"Silly question here, aren't NSAIDs not recommended when bleeding because they could make you bleed more? Or that I was told when I had a byopsy and the nurse said I can take Tylenol but not Ibuprofen or else there could be more risk of bleeding. I'm confused now, can you tell me if it's ok to have Ibuprofen?",7

Haha like trying to distract you more, we just had our shepherd have her pups on our couch while we were out for 2 hours. She has 8 puppies now. Our couch is ruined haha but everyone is doing fine.",175
,,,,You may not need to donate for her but it would be nice to donate for someone else in a similar situation someday. I work at a blood center and supply has been very low lately. Young male donors are great because they usually can spare the blood and their blood is statistically safer for patients to receive because they are unlikely to have antibodies due to lack of antigen exposure.,17
,,,,"That's actually a pretty reasonable thought because usually when I get my blood drawn (I've had to do it a *lot* lately) they talk about something totally off-topic, like, ""Hey have you been to that new rock climbing gym?"" They're not asking me when the last time I got a mole checked because hello don't ask anything that could even potentially be scary while dealing with blood unless you need to. So thinking they'd have to do a transfusion? Not a silly thought at all.


You've done really well. I hope you're super proud of yourself. You've handled a medical emergency calmly, you were engaged with your sister about something that can be objectively gross (I'm a woman, I know periods can be gross, especially clots like she's had, that's just nature being nature), and you tried to prepare for what was to come (bringing the squishmallow was the action of someone who understands and cares about their sibling and prepared for future needs). You're 19, so even though you're the big brother, in the grand scheme of things you're still young and you did everything above and beyond what a lot of 19yos would do. Well done, dude.",13
,,,,">her vitals now are 101/65 and 80\\

Way better! 

If she needs a transfusion, the blood has already been donated and tested and is sitting in the blood bank ... but have your friends and family donate anyway. There is never enough blood! (I worked blood bank at times and we were always on the thin edge of running out)",9
,,,,"Glad to hear she’s doing better. I also wanted to say, you remind me so much of my big brother. We aren’t close anymore cause reasons, but he was always there for me when we were growing up and I miss him so fucking much.

Hahahah

But seriously, you're awesome.

Once your sister is settled, the doctor should be coming by to talk.

The medical team will ask her many questions. Let her answer them. Chime in if you need to provide additional info, but otherwise let her talk. She knows her body best.

The team may ask many of the same questions frequently, especially name and date of birth. They will ask to collect samples (blood, urine) and ask about ordering imaging tests.

Hopefully she will start getting answers and treatment soon!",277

Mentioning her wisdom teeth removal 2 months ago, if she did or didn’t have any complications, is actually very valuable and helpful history that you provided for working up possible differentials. You did great brother. Hemoglobin <7 (saw she was under in another comment) is typically the standard guideline for giving a transfusion.

Female of reproductive age bleeding like that is going to be seen as fast as possible. It could be nothing or it could be one of *those* emergencies that are seconds from needing large numbers of docs and transfusions.

And yes, the lights are ghastly.",5

,,,,"Hey buddy, I'm NAD, but I'm a person who JUST went to the ER for my period! I was bleeding way, way, way too heavily for way too long. We know our bodies, and with pain like that, and filling that many pads within a short amount of time, as well as blood clots bigger than a silver dollar, it's best to get checked out! I ended up needing medication for the bleeding, fluids, IV nausea meds, and I feel sooooo much better. I understand you're trying to be a supportive big brother while also not going overboard as a babysitter, but when a person says ""this isn't right, help me"", it's better to be safe.",54
,,,,"I am not a doctor but I am a mother. I would go to urgent care/ er if I started feeling lightheaded, if the clots were bigger than my closed fist, if I was bleeding through more than 2 heavy day pads in less than an hour, if I had any reason to suspect a miscarriage. Also tampons are the ones that go inside you like a plug. A pad is an absorbant sticky thing that you stick on your undies. Most women typically only lose a couple teaspoons or tablespoons of blood a month but you can lose more if there is an issue and it can at times be dangerous. I'd say if she feels like this is an urgent enough issue to warrant waiting for hours in the er then she may need to go.  Worst case if you go is, its just a heavier than normal period and we all overreacted. Worst case if you don't go is that she could be losing dangerous amounts of blood. Can you clarify if she's using a tampon or pad? Tampons may not sit correctly and can leak. Pads can fill up with blood fast. I typically go through around 1 heavy day pad every 2 hours during the first day of my cycle then it tapers off from there. Also see if there are any nurse advice lines in your state. Usually they are free to call and get immediate answers on what's normal vs not.",38

,,,,"Actually, random donor blood is usually just as safe if not safer than directed donations. Blood transfusions from close relatives increase the chance of graft vs host disease.

I work in a blood bank.",155
,,,,"Just like the other poster said, directed donations from family aren't typically recommended due to GVHD risk even though leukoreduction filtration is standard now when processing blood product donations and irradiation of the product can remove the residual WBCs. The only time we really do directed donations from family members is when the patient has an antibody to a high frequency antigen or has a very rare blood type, like Bombay or Rh null, that a family member is significantly more likely to have the same phenotype as the patient than a random donor. 

Also, unlike what Hollywood loves to portray for the drama, blood donations can't go directly from donor to patient. Processing and testing donations for infectious diseases usually takes roughly 48 hours. It'd be significantly faster for them to transfuse B-, O+, or O- random donor blood instead or just order more B+ from their supplier than it would be to specifically collect from her brother unless they live in such a remote area that blood has to be flown in.

2) Brother is an adult who was left with care of the sister.  Even if he doesn't have any papers,  he's acting in guardianship 

3) If we can't find parents, we assume that any sane parent would want their child taken care of in an emergency.  If you can't find a parent, we assume that they would say,  ""Save my kid.""",22

Second step is CYA, because I guess they WOULD'VE loved parental consent for everything, they can't get it right now.

Which'll help their side if this ever becomes a court case, but won't make it a home run.  
  
But if they'd waited for parental consent on everything OP's sister would be fuckin'dead right now. AND they'd be facing a worse-odds wrongful death suit because they let a 15yo bleed to death in their ER.  I'm quite sure even the hospital's lawters would agree they're handling this textbook.",11

Like please reread this and hear yourself. She's freaking out, it's not her first period, she's bleeding enough it's soaking near everything and there's clumps and your first thought is ""this doesn't seem like a big deal it's supposed to suck."" That's not a good response or approach and if you hadn't come to reddit to get it confirmed she may have had more risks or something awful happen. 

Good for deciding to take her now but if you had or ever get a girlfriend if you swing that way *please* just listen to women on this stuff. If you've never had it happen personally you don't know and don't have the knowledge or good thought to make the call on if what a woman is saying is an er trip or not. 

Also it would be good measure to apologize to your sister for dismissing and downplaying her concerns. She knows her body best and you should've listened without reddit involvement.

I'm glad OP listened to the comments but what if it hadn't had a comment at all? People are getting angry at my comment despite it being very calm and non-aggressive and gentle but there's a reason I made it and it's because OPs sisters stats are straight up terrifying which is why it's an important factor to believe people when they tell you something is wrong and they need medical attention.",83
,,,,"Please take her in! 

Do not hesitate to be stern/firm with the doctor. Ask for at least a night of monitoring. She is bleeding way too much to be at home unmonitored.",-18
,,,,"Not trying to be mean but if you don't know anything about periods and what is and isn't normal for a period, why would you not just trust your sister to know when something's wrong? She TOLD you she needs to go to the ER. You downplayed her problems every step of the way. If you don't know something and there is someone near you who does know better, then trust their judgment on when it's time to go to the hospital",-8
,,,,Depends on the person. I can easily bleed out an ultra size in an hour the first 2-3 days of mine. I never use anything below super plus during them whole period. Some people can use regular or even light ones and never bleed out. It’s all subjective to each individual’s “norm” :),9

Then be a good big brother and stay there with her. She will always remember it and it will make up for you not listening to her earlier. She will probably want you to step out for the dr exam, but will want you there for the rest. Be understanding and expect it to take awhile.",146

If not, don’t buy them. Just if you have them. The hospital should have something like that when you get there.

Edit: also bring phone chargers (don’t forget the wall block) and entertainment. Like books, handheld video game thing, laptop, tablet, etc. because it’s probably gonna be a long, boring time. Also snacks if you can. Earplugs or headphones as well. I was stuck in an ER waiting room with this guy who was vomitting very loudly and my earplugs saved me.",18
,,,,"Just go. Take your phone chargers. And if your parents gave you a letter granting medical guardianship, take that as well. And yes please, stay with her.",13
,,,,Just go,10
,,,,"You are allowed to call 911 and an ambulance comes to get her. The 911 operator will ask you questions, you just answer with the facts. 

The advantage of ambulance is they can start IV fluids right away, if anyone is leaking blood at a dangerous rate, at a certain point the empty blood vessels can start to get collapsed like sn empty gogurt tube, get sticky and clot. Thats really bad fir your brain, lungs, heart, etc.

When they start a saline IV drip bag, the fluids fluff up the blood vessels, like holding the empty gogurt tube so tap water fills it and props it open.

The IV fluids are a stop gap until they can get an order (emergency prescription) for a blood transfusion. 

The other nice thing about 911 / the ambulance is that if they think she is bleeding to death, THEY can radio ahead to the hospital in order to get an ER operation room available, and have type O blood brought to her as they run cart to the OR.

Ambulances don't have to stop at traffic lights or park... and the ambulance pull in spot has people ready & waiting to ""catch"" patients coming in with trauma. 

The EMT's on the ambulance also travel in pairs or more... so the team can lift her and carry her through a building or down stairs as needed, one person (you) can not carry a grown person well. 

These advantages of ambulances mean a trip that could take you 25 minutes traveling her from the bathroom to the ER... the ambulance can accomplish in under 10. 

If a person is bleeding to death, every minute really counts. For example, the lack of oxygen can start to cause permanent brain damage in like 10 minutes depending on various variables.

Usually the Ambulances will offer a ride either with them or a cop car... this is so you don't get into a cash crash driving all stressed.

You would wait at the hospital to answer questions, because your sister may pass out and the staff wants/needs hints from an awake person.

You will likely be there for 4 hours to overnight. At some point when things are stable, you would have a chance to go pick up phone chargers, and and other sundries, like glasses, entertainment objects, snacks or an overnight kit. 

During this ""break"" go Get a comfortable change of clothes for her, stretchy with no tight/long sleeves, if she has a stretchy button-up short sleeve shirt, in a dark color that is ideal. Dark, Loose Yoga pants or sweat pants or shorts with a fold down waist is ideal, but any stretch pants are good. Same with bra and underwear.

These choices are best because she will need clean (not bloody) clothes to return home in. If you are dying, sometimes the cut the clothes away to save time. Her inner elbow/ arm may have an IV tube or a bruise where the IV attached. If she has abdominal surgery, she could have several small 2"" cuts or one longer one... Fresh incisions are tender, firm clothing  like jeans with a zipper may pinch or rub painfully even though the wounds will have gauss and tape covering them.

If she doesn't have an overnight kit, and must stay at the hospital... they will provide objects like toothpaste, lip balm, shampoo, lotion, socks, etc. So don't bother going on a hunt for these if she doesn't keep a travel kit packed & ready.",12
,,,,"Not who you were replying to but you can just go, you don't need to call.  Health insurance card if you have one, phone charger.  You should stay with her.",6
,,,,Just go and explain,5
,,,,"The pelvic floor is literally a bowl of muscles that hangs above your pelvis bones so you organs have a hammock and don't fall out your butt. Every standard human had pelvic floor muscles, boys and girls. 

There are a couple holes in the pelvic floor muscle hammock;  a pee tube (urethra), vagina/birth canal, an  poop tube (anus). These holes are almost the same structure as the mouth, kind of a drawstring muscle. 

Boys don't the vagina hole. Thats why they have two holes and girls have three.

If the emergency room staff believe their in injury or illness to any of these parts, they may do several types of tests. Some include various high tech devices that can see through flesh to view inner (not visible) structures before they determine if surgery is appropriate. 

Generally these machines are things Like xray, ultrasound machine, cat scan, or MRI. The staff treating her will select the right tools. They do different things well, so it's not like one is good and another one is bad... they just serve different purposes, similar to how sometime you need a hammer and sometimes you need  wrench.

Other tests can involve visual inspection or touching the outside of body with a gloved hand in order to search for surface level cuts or punctures that might need physical pressure urgently to slow the bleeding on the way to scans or surgery. Basically, they are looking for the leaks and to plug them with gauze.",43
,,,,"Don’t worry about all of that honestly, just make sure she’s seen. She’s probably fine but with heavy bleeding like that they’ll need to do some tests to figure out why. Make sure you tell her to be totally honest with the doctors and nurses. If she’s sexually active they need to know. It could be a miscarriage from an early pregnancy… she might not even realize it herself. If it is it’s not uncommon but she needs to be examined.",41

Congrats on getting a trial run at parenting! I remember arriving home and my kid was so happy to tell me she finally ate mushrooms and she liked them! Previously, she wouldn't even touch a pizza if it had one mushroom on it. I asked her where she got these mushrooms? She pointed at the shade under our tree. Well, I knew what I was doing that evening! A little pre-dinner ER! I grabbed a bunch of the mushrooms and sent a picture to a friend who forages wild mushrooms. She said they were almost certainly an edible species but go to the ER in case. Some liver enzyme tests and some activated charcoal and everything was good. Later found out that, by chance, the mushrooms were indeed edible. Unlucky luck. The bonus is that from then on, my kid would eat mushrooms. One of our many family stories.",18

,,,,"It's good to know though it actually doesn't make much sense for you to donate blood to her unless they're very low on her blood type.

Ironically the same reason that relatives make good organ donor candidates, high likelihood that you inherited similar MHC genes (also called HLA), actually makes it more likely for a problem to occur (though there's procedures to avoid that problem occurring at all so you'd be fine if they have something to do them).

Red blood cells and platelets don't have MHCs which is why donating blood is so much easier than organs. You just need to match blood type. But there's also white cells in blood. Almost every time you donate blood your immune system will see the donor white cells as foreign and kill them. A very small amount of the time the MHC genes will be similar enough that they'll each see eachother as the same and be fine. But a very very small amount of the time the MHC genes will be close but not quite matches and your cells see them as fine, but they see you as foreign and start attacking you. If you're related the later two are more likely. Though this can be prevented by procedures that filter out or kill the white blood cells (I actually worked on a system that does that among other things).",11

I've been in and out of hospitals ER's way too many times for a 25 year old, they're not too scary, just a bit boring while you wait.

I'm not a doctor, but in my own experience they may take your sister in relatively quick since it's involving bleeding. Doesn't mean anything scary, but they'll likely want her where they can monitor her quickly.

As long as you have chargers everything else is superfluous and they might even have some to borrow.

(One thing for the future, but way too important to forget about: please pass on to your sister that a lot of the diagnosis that tend to go along with her symptoms can really wreck one’s ability to have natural children. This is something in my experience that even OBGYN’s won’t bring up to their patients. It’s just something that tends to be completely off peoples’ radar unless they are deep in that world. If I had my diagnoses at her age, and was educated about protecting fertility, I would have seriously considered freezing a bunch of eggs for the future. It would have saved me a lot of financial stress and emotional suffering down the road, that’s for sure. Just encourage her to research her diagnoses and how they may affect her having children so she can advocate for herself. Your parents could even have the kind of insurance that covers that stuff, which is definitely something to take advantage of if it’s there.)",4

My brother actually had to do this with our sister when they were a bit younger than you and your sister. Similar problem too.

He made an absolute bollocks of it. Like he was far more clueless than you. No sunscreen, but he did bring half the contents of the medicine cabinet—nail clippers, aloe vera gel and condoms. He also learned that day that babies and pee come out of different holes.

And no, my sister still hasn’t let him live it down.

,,,,Could be either way. I would imagine from a lot of experience that they would start an IV immediately with her vitals. Usually when they start an IV on me or use my port they first attach the tubes for blood draws and then attached iv tubing primed for fluids/meds. It’s possible they came in and did blood work and then started an IV later.,3

If I was your mom, I would be proud of you for getting advice and then proceeding with a visit to the er. I cannot imagine your mother being angry for you caring about your sisters wellbeing. Is there another adult in your life that you could contact to help take some of this pressure away? Maybe a grandmother, aunt, cousin, female friend, etc? Someone to make the decision with you?",13

,,,,"Yes, autologous donations are the safest since it’s the patients own blood being given back to them. But this obviously wouldn’t happen if the patient is already anemic. 

If two related people are a perfect HLA match, then the chance of GVHD or other transfusion reactions is indeed low. It’s when there is only a slight mismatch that there is an issue. If the patient is heterozygous and the donor is homozygous, there is a chance that the donor cells will attack the patient as foreign while the patient’s immune system thinks the donor cells look normal to them and won’t fight back.",36
,,,,"The problem is actually specifically because their MHCs (HLA) might be close matches. Your RBCs and platelets don't have MHCs and you don't need the donor's white blood cells. That's why for blood it's type matters but MHC matching isn't needed like for organs. The vast majority of the time your body will see them as foreign and kill them. A very small amount of the time they'll think each looks similar enough to the other that it's fine. A very small amount of the time your body won't see them as foreign but they will see you as foreign and start attacking you.

Being related actually increases the chance of this so generally close relative blood donors are to be avoided.

Though it can be prevented by procedures that filter out or kill the white blood cells (I actually worked on a system that does that among other things). Japan apparently does it on all blood donations because Japan is 98.1% Japanese and thus is very good for finding compatible organs, not so good if you want to avoid transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease.",23
,,,,"One reason I can think of is in terms of blood supply. Some smaller facilities don’t carry any blood types other than O packed red blood cells and A or AB plasma for emergency purposes. If there was a major blood shortage occurring perhaps they didn’t want to use up their stock if you were not type O. The only other time a family member’s blood might be preferable is if you have an antibody to a high incidence antigen, in which case it would be much easier to find compatible blood from relatives than testing a large number of donors.

Every other instance donor blood is much preferred so I have no idea why they would have suggested otherwise.",3

Then she informed me it doesn’t have estrogen and I told her to sign me up. 

The bleeding was much lighter within the first couple months and after maybe 7-9 months my periods were down to the point I could wear nothing but a liner and still barely see anything. Once in a while I’ll have a more regular period but never anything like before. My cramps disappeared too.

,,,,"It’s ok you can apologize to her. You can’t go back and change the past but you learned a lot today. That’s what matters. Not that only, but your post very likely helped other people who didn’t know what to do in this situation.

I would suggest watching a couple videos on TikTok or YouTube of men trying a period stimulator to see how painful they are. Really nice of you to help her clean up and get her a blanket etc. Periods are horrible and they can make you have bad pain, sore breasts, acne, trouble sleeping, nausea, diarrhea, and make you super emotional and cranky etc 

So a pad is a strip basically that goes in someone’s underwear that has a sticky side that sticks to the underwear. They can come in a very thin pad for before you get your period or at the very end. All the way up to these huge, thick pads that are basically like diapers for heavy flow/overnight.

A tampon is basically a piece of cotton with a string attached to it that usually comes in a plastic applicator. A woman inserts it into her vagina and pushes on the applicator. This releases only the cotton into her vagina. The string is pulled and a new tampon should be replaced every 4-8 hours. 

There are also period plastic silicone cups that can be inserted into the vagina and even things like reusable pads. 

A period is caused by monthly shedding of the uterus which results in vaginal bleeding.

Tips for women in your life when they are on their period: Be kind and understanding. Sorry we are so crazy with our periods, we can’t help it! A heating pad and chocolate are usually really wonderful.

Please update us on your sister.

I've seen so many women post photos of their uterine lining that comes out in large pieces during menstruation on reddit. There are new posts like every week with them. And I know some people do experience heavy bleeding. And he said she's known to overreact with blood and minor cuts. So I can really see how he was unsure. 

But absolutely because this isn't a normal occurrence for her menstruation, I'd have taken her in to the ER. I'd rather it be nothing than the alternative. And I'd prefer a professional make that call, not me. Glad they went in.",52
,,,,⚡️🏆⚡️,5
,,,,"I did give him credit where credit was due. It was the ""but periods are supposed to suck right?"" That told me he was leaning towards more dismissive than confused. 
19 yr old men are still extremely capable of observing and using some basic reasoning of ""okay I've never seen this before and she's had her periods for years so this isn't normal and if she's bleeding that much and she's saying it requires a hospital that doesn't sound unreasonable."" 
He's more than smart and capable enough to make that connection. Trying to excuse him from it says he's not capable when he very much is.",-26
,,,,"I was helpful. I pointed out that if he believed his sister at face value the post would not have been needed. Believing the people who are familiar with what's going on with their body and when something is off is a valuable skill that does relate to this medical issue because depending on how much she is bleeding she may end up getting lightheaded enough to faint or experience menstruation induced anemia. 

I'm sorry you viewed it as not helpful, but that frankly is not my problem.",-45
,,,,">He thought a blood clot was an organ.

Yeah that part I blame on public school. But if he's lived with his sister and she's had her period before he would hopefully have observed enough to see there was an issue. 

Also: 


>He thought a blood clot was an organ

He thought that and *still* refused to take her to an ER? By your own point it sounds far, far worse He came here first. I made my point and left it be from there. More people are harassing me than I ever harassed him especially since mine wasn't harassment.

Edit to add I didn't even think harshly on the organ mistake. I understood that freak out. What was concerning is he thought that, freaked out and still went here before the ER.",11

,,,,"This ^ is good response, explaining why it's unnecessary. Sometimes doctors will ask to see things or you may want to bring something in because you can not identify it and may want to ask questions or have a poor memory and have a hard time describing it. I myself bring things in because I've had doctors dismiss me or withhold information or misdiagnosis.

I told them to bring it in because I wasn't sure and I don't know how their ER runs. Most doctors are good people, but I've had some bad run-ins. This was a perfect response.

Thank you for responding in the manner that you did, this was very helpful and educating. ❤️",2

I'm pretty sure my lil dude only got curious because he overheard some peers on a video game smack talking each other and the word tampon came up, so he asked about em. 

Then on of the peers had heard an rumor that in real life, soldiers can use tampons to plug a bullet hole in combat.  

So my kiddo had some questions about tampons, almost like video game stats.

So I got out a couple types, plus panty liners, pads, pads with wings... the whole kit. And talked about normal use, and let him unwrap them, and see how much water they hold.

Someday he's gonna live with a lady, have a wife, maybe have daughters... like half the people in the world are chics... so it's worth knowing something about.

And thanks to reddit, I was locked & loaded to clearup some confusion that seems common;

Number of holes, how & when pregnancy can happen, how each women's cycle is individual and varies a lot in the begging and tail end of having periods, type age of onset, and menopause, that pads stick to CLOTHING, not the person like a bandaid, and some people barely notice the discomfort & some people get so sick it's like diarrhea cramping for 5 days a month. Even simply stuff like periods are supposed to start and only last a week, so if you know someone who has one that starts and keeps bleeding for 3+ weeks in a row, they need a doctor, etc.

My kiddo is really bright & resourceful, so I want to make sure I give him ""news you can use"" so that if he has friends that ask him stuff, he's a good source of info instead of more confusion.

The other thing that worked good is to get BOTH the boys and girls books for the topic of puberty. Their are lots on amazon that are age appropriate, I think the ones I got were from the same publisher that makes the American Girls Dolls series... 

The kiddo was VERY interested in both books. I periodically see they have been moved in his room over the years, so I think he is going back to them like reference books. I think some people only provide one book of the kids own gender, but I think it's better to provide both.",24

If she made a habit of being dramatic or lying or frequently asking to go (or going) to the ER, I'm sure he would have included that kind of information. 

So barring that, his reasoning should have been something like ""had periods for years, never had clots the size of a hackey sack, never stained the couch, never went through multiple tampads in a hour, never had to go to the ER, have never seen period blood running down her legs"" + ""now all these things are happening"" + ""**sister asking to go to the ER**"" = ""probably should go to the ER""

She's not ""on his ass"" and if you read through the  replies (granted, there are quite a lot), she's not really saying anything other people haven't said, and they didn't get downvoted for it. Emphasizing that *believe women about their bodies* should have been priority #1 is not a bad thing. Now that his sister is in the hospital, this is a learning opportunity, something he can take with him to be an overall better, wiser, person.

Even knowing he's not an expert on periods, and ""knowing"" little else except ""they're supposed to suck, right?"" he wasn't willing to cede the mantle of expertise to the woman with the problem, instead coming to Reddit to verify. This is a huge long-term issue for OP's future girlfriends (if that's his orientation), friends who are girls who may need to rely on him in an emergency, even female coworkers who may have a problem. 

>Is that how you respond to feedback? Saying not my problem?

For you to paraphrase this the way you did lacks context. I'm not sure if it's context you weren't following, or if you did it on purpose, but it's not like she said this in a vacuum.
She was responding to someone who told her to ""be helpful or be quiet,"" to which she said it wasn't her problem that they didn't view it as helpful. The person gave ""feedback,"" but in general, it wasn't helpful feedback. It didn't consider the purpose or content of her post, because it considered her tone ""too harsh"" for an adult. It would be perfectly normal to disregard such feedback. Why are you giving it merit?",-1
,,,,If you thought my response was harsh when I did not insult him or belittle him than it appears you're not one who takes feedback well. There was nothing harsh about my statement.,-14
,,,,"I'm asking this to you for clarification because I can't wrap my head around it, if we put you in this situation as the 15 yr old, even at 18 where it's: (I also want to make a point to say I am a blunt person who defaults to direct language and sentence structures, I'm not being rude or aggressive I just don't see the point to flutter around what I mean in these kinds of discussions)

-you've had your period for a lil bit now and never experienced this before (this one I do recognize is an assumption because it's never said if she's had similar) 

-you go through 3 pads in what if I mapped right is less than 3 hours or so. To the point it's going down your leg

-you expelled a clot the size of a hacky sack as OP describe, which is roughly the size of one of those cutie oranges 

-you feel like you're going to vomit, likely expressly lightheaded and dizzy (op mentioned in a comment his sisters BP was 70-something over 54 when the docs checked so that likely caused some sensation 

-your heart rate is 133 which is equivalent of running on a treadmill, while laying down. May not have immediate numbers but you will feel that trying to escape your chest

-you go to the bathroom and proceed to have more blood clots that from the sound of it aren't tiny (by tiny I mean a usd quarter or smaller) 

-the bleeding does not appear to be stopping and if I estimating the time right was going on for at least 3-5 hours with no stop in sight, maybe more if you count the reddit post and the extra hour between ""okay were going"" to ""okay were here."" 

-and the people responsible for your medical bills have had enough money to travel internationally for roughly a week (he says 6 days but a half day for prep and travel to the airport pre boarding to destination and back) 

And you would still not even attempt an urgent care at the least if not an ER? Would you go if it was your daughter experiencing this and she never had before? Or lets say you have a sister in this scenerio youre caring for, would you hesitate? No alarms would be going off at all? No thought to call a local doctor you or who your caring for sees? 
Or even this...would you Google it? Because in my original comment I edited to add that part of my concern is posts on here have gone unanswered before for hours. 

My other concern with it was women tend to not be believed or trusted to know what's going on with their bodies, especially from men. Especially around our periods and reproductive organ issues. We get conditioned to brush even scary stuff off and it's because of situations like this where a dad or older brother or doctor had the same attitude OP did (which he did admit he wasnt taking it seripusly in another comment). Her own brother was showing her that she won't be believed when she really needs help and based on her stats she *really* needed help. I have some faith in the world that based on his comments he learned from it and recognizes he messed up. Like...something in my soul settled down seeing he owned his mistake. But I genuiely am struggling to understand how when it's that many symptoms someone wouldn't go ""money be damned they got payment programs"" and try to at least go to the first least expensive option possible.

Also to really quickly add, if your period is subject to change after about the first two years or so it's that something is throwing it off. Maybe not howany days but the time clock should be pretty on schedule and flow fairly consistent. I've been monitoring my daughter's since they got it and her doctors have confirmed there's something off because even for the 1st two years it's very very off. If it's off that much there's an underlying issue.",3

,,,,"I completely understand your concerns, but I can also totally see why OP googled for advice. I don’t think it’s that he didn’t believe her, I think it was more like he struggled to compute bc it’s not what he expected an emergency to look like. I used to babysit my siblings/cousins a lot when I was younger, and short of something that very clearly required police/ambos/firies, my idea of an emergency would have involved some kind external injury. Bleeding out from my vagina wouldn’t have even made my list of possible scenarios. And tbh, even if it were on the list, sometimes it can still take a second to sink in. When I was 15 and my brother (14) sliced his hand with a knife and ended up needing stitches, my reply to him when he asked me to call mum back (she has left home literally 5 minutes earlier) wasn’t “okay, I’ll call mum”, it was “call mum? Why? what do you mean you stabbed yourself? How? Oh, guess I should call mum. Just sit down and stop freaking out”. Obviously that was not the appropriate response, but it wasn’t that I didn’t believe he hurt himself, I just couldn’t process quickly enough to respond better. Both my mum and brother still poke fun at me occasionally for sounding like I was annoyed at the inconvenience hahah. 

Also, I can offer another perspective on your hypothetical situation. I do want to be clear that I’m not at all intending to contradict your point that there are definite red flags for just going to emergency. But from personal experience, I can see how some of the lines get blurred. 

I’ve had my period for 15 years, and it has never been regular. If I experience something new, my response is “huh, that’s a new one”, and I’ll note it down just in case (but even that’s a relatively new habit). 

I didn’t realise that my periods were actually pretty heavy until after I got a mirena when I was 22 in hope that’d make them stop (it didn’t, but they are much much lighter) bc I hated dealing with them. Not to the extent of OP’s sister, but clots and it running down my leg were normal for me. I genuinely thought I was just really bad at managing them and felt insecure about it. The only upside was that I never got cramps (unfortunately, the mirena gave me those, but I’ll take it over the constant fear that I’m leaking though my pants every time I feel a clot come out, or having blood run down my leg just after I’ve showered).

My resting heart rate is over 100bpm. I’m pretty healthy, ECGs I’ve had look fine. GP says that’s just my normal.

Again, I totally get where you’re coming from. I’ve been having a frustrating time with my doctor’s actually listening and taking me seriously (sometimes I feel like I’d have a more productive conversation with a wall), but I can also emphasise with OPs position.",10
,,,,"Admittedly, my first thought would probably not be to go to the ER. I would assume they just have a really bad period or it’s a sign of a more common condition like endometriosis. The only reason I know better now is because I happened upon this thread. I just don’t think most teens of either sex are equipped to deal with something like this (or maybe im just especially slow, idk). 

And for what it’s worth, my period symptoms are very mild so this would be unusual for me, but from what I’ve heard from other girls, symptoms like heavy bleeding, large clots, and terrible cramps are the norm. Periods are so different for everyone that I couldn’t say for sure whether someone’s symptoms are normal or not.",13

I'm not sure how to break this to you but just because it's normal due to doctors dismissal of those girls you spoke to doesn't mean it's actually normal. There's two normals, the one where it's supposed to be like something and no problems and the one where it's clearly a sign something is off but is downplayed so much the people experiencing it ""normalize"" it to cope with it. 

Endometriosis can definitely send you to the ER if it's not treated because it can become an issue. Same with PCOS, they're called disorders or illnesses for a reason. 

I honestly think the younger generation has just been conditioned too strongly to think things aren't as big a deal as they actually are and I think lots of schools and doctors are to blame for it but my *whole* original point to my original comment is *OPs sister knew it was an emergency and told him that and he didn't believe her and that is the issue.* she knew, she was together and educated enough to know and he dismissed her originally.

The doctor would explain that it's for acne, not for contraception. Yes, some people are still opposed to birth control as a blanket rule, but that's not the norm. It's certainly possible, but all /u/mmbbccnn  said was that it was *most likely* that she'd be taking the OCP as well.

Because seeking care at the ER is “free” (I do pay for it on my taxes) or an ambulance because either my para-medical insurance covers it (if I have one) or the bill is about $200-$300 if I don’t have one. 

OP, *quite clearly* is concerned about the expense of going to the ER for something he’s not familiar with. He *did* ask for guidance. He didn’t just sit there and think he knows better. He *quite clearly* grew increasingly concerned for his sister. 

Is OP perfect? No, he’s not. Nobody is. Does he lack knowledge about periods? Sure, he does! 

He’s also a 19yo American kid. If you want to blame this on anyone, blame it on your education and healthcare systems.",21
,,,,Alright I admitted I was being a dick. She didn’t even tell me she wanted to go to the ER until later on. I’ve never had a period idk. But I’ve never been in the hospital before and neither has my sister so idk what you expect me to know I’m not a doctor. Like I fully admit I should’ve just gone with it when she said it the first time but I was trying to figure out if it was really necessary or we could handle it at home. Obviously we couldn’t. We went in. Roast me for being a dick to my sister but you don’t have to overanalysis everything I say. I thought this post was just gonna be for doctors,64

You're human, and you're gonna make mistakes no matter how old you are.  Even my SO and I had a moment last year when we wrestled between taming my 14yo stepdaughter to urgent care or the ER.  Because the ER is not somewhere you feel like you should reflexively go to if you're not sure it's truly an emergency, I get it.

On that note, that's something to think about on the future. If something is wrong medically and you're not sure, during regular office hours you can call your regular doctor and they can usually advise you based on what you say is wrong.  If you can't reach them, you can look up local urgent care doctor offices and call them.  Often times, both of these choices have nurses on staff to talk to patients over the phone and help determine how serious a situation is and what the patient should do.

But bottom line, no matter what, i promise any nurse, doctor, or parent worth a damn will not be angry at you for choosing to go to the ER just in case.

I am absolutely sure you don't hate your sister.  If you ask me, that's a million percent obvious.  And I don't feel like you were ""mansplaining"" or anything as some have said.  You were just trying not to panic and overreact, and that's entirely understandable.

And I don't blame you for being tired and starting yo react to the assholes.  You've had a long ass day or two with this, I'm sure.  Take a breath and remind yourself not to let them get to you, they don't matter.  Your sister matters, and I'm sure she loved and appreciates you.

If we're just going to quote from random blogs, at least here is one from an OBGYN practice [https://rockvilleobgyn.com/blog/uti-myths/] : 


""**If You Use Tampons, You Are at an Increased Risk**


""Using tampons does not actually increase your risk of developing a UTI. In fact, tampons can actually help to prevent a UTI. This is because they are designed to absorb moisture and keep the external area as dry as possible. Since bacteria thrive in moist environments, tampons actually manage bacterial populations by keeping the area dry.""


And then, for a more credible source, the American Urology Association Journal 
https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000000296 (edit to add this link wasn't working, not sure if I fixed it, but if not the article is ""Recurrent Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections in Women: AUA/CUA/SUFU Guideline"") 


""Unfortunately, there are many commonly held myths surrounding lifestyle modification. Case-control studies clearly demonstrate that changes in hygiene practices (front to back wiping), pre- and post-coital voiding, avoidance of hot tubs, tampon use, and douching, do not play a role in rUTI prevention.""


You keep commenting that people are believing doctors or certain websites over you. Well, yeah. Your personal experience, or what you believe it to be, does not make something a fact. I can say, ""hey, I got a UTI from eating Raisin Bran!"" but that doesn't make it true, and it doesn't mean that people should believe me over a trained medical professional because it's my ""lived experience."" That is not how medicine or science in general works. 


I cannot imagine this conversation is going to progress much beyond this as, judging from your other comments, you are convinced of what you believe to be true. So, I won't be responding any further, but I do hope you are able to find some help for the medical issues you're dealing with; it's very frustrating to feel you're not being taken seriously.

We saw doctors for months and months with no answers only scary “maybes”. On paper he was healthy but started to lose his ability to walk, hold things and basically function as a normal kid. 

Desperate for answers I wrote everything out here. I’ve since deleted the post since it included personal details. In 10 minutes I had two physicians tell me it was Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. Two hospitalizations later (the first telling us he did NOT have JIA and most likely had a form of MD) we finally got diagnosed with JIA. We started treatment and two weeks later he was better, 6 months later walking with no limp at all and today almost a year later free of all disease activity.

Diagnosis is so important and it changed our lives. Thanks to the doctors who helped us. I hope you remember who you are!",,

Doc on here saved my life,4147,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/156kjji/doc_on_here_saved_my_life/,"Edit: I deleted the vaping post a while ago because doctors kept judging me for it. I’ve kept screenshots of it, they were moderators telling me NOT to go to the ER making me feel stupid. At eosinophil of 5800. So yeah. I’m not lying about the post I just deleted it because of anxiety before the hospital trip because I thought I was dumb about everything. 

Don’t know if you remember. I’m 24F and my post got a lot of discussion under it due to its nature (hypereosinophilia, vaping marijuana, etc). 

There was only one doctor (@BmoresFnst) who pushed for me to see heme at eosinophil of 5.8, which had been ranging between 1.9-2.2 for six-eight months prior w no follow up (range: 0.0-0.5). 

Everyone else told me it’s b/c of the vaping. Well, I ended up in the ER for six days and I went thru a bone marrow biopsy and all sorts of imaging and everything, the  heme at the ER told me vaping cannot cause those levels - turns out I had lupus and now I’m on 5 different medications just to control it. They found the eosinophilia just in time too and my organs were fine. Also so many different doctors. Also still vaping (nothing helps with the pain not even Imuran…)

So… yeah. Thanks to that doctor. And this sub. That’s all.

Edit: For those wondering, my current medication is pregabalin 75 mg twice a day, prednisone 20 mg everyday after a depo medrol 250 mg 2 injection situation 3 weeks ago, imuran (200 mg i think. or is it 150? it’s two pills. i just know that) and hydroxychloroquin 200 mg 2x a day!

edit 2: ok we’re back to diagnosis in process cuz i’m hypereosinophilic off the steroids. we don’t know what’s going on and bone marrow just says 20%> eosinophil…",,

,,,,"Kudos to you for saving and changing someone’s life. It sounds like you know alot about lupus so I was wondering if you thought I should try to get a work up for that or other autoimmune conditions. I was super healthy (personal trainer three times a week, walked 5-7 miles a day with my dog, ate healthy, played tennis, didn’t drink or smoke) prior to getting hit with a few unfortunate things back to back. This includes some sort of illness while traveling which, in retrospect, I probably should have treated (we shared meal after which my husband ended up with inflamed appendix on IV meds in the ER but they told me if I was just having GI issues my immune system should take care of it). And then Covid. But since then I’ve had host of vague symptoms. Started with extreme fatigue and muscle weakness and then vomiting after any kind of workout. I thought maybe it was hormones but that was normal. Then I thought maybe I’m just burnt out so I took a brief sabbatical from my job (since it is very demanding) but that didn’t help and during that time I also started developing joint pain and hair loss as well as prominent veins. Then all of a sudden I woke up with extreme bladder and back pain. And ever since I’ve been worked up with a number of differentials but the findings all vague. I have bladder wall thickening, mild prominence of right renal pelvis, etc. my doctors said it could be interstitial cystitis but that I don’t really fit neatly into that bucket (no urgency and frequency, no urethral burning, no small bladder capacity, normal voiding) and that it doesn’t really explain other symptoms. 

Saw top IC doc in country (who does a ton of research and sees patients from all over and usually seems to diagnose everyone he sees with IC) and even he wasn’t convinced it was IC (although he said it is possible with just an abnormal or complex case). Everything is worse when I sit or stand in one place. Basically helps to lay flat. Or sometimes a little bit of just pacing or walking. I’ve failed all of the traditional meds for IC and pelvic floor physical therapy for pelvic floor dysfunction (I do if daily just incase and PT says no more tightness or trigger points). 

I just feel like my bladder is swollen and painful. And my back really hurts even though no real pathological findings on lumbar spine MRI beyond cluster of tarvlov cysts which often aren’t considered symptomatic but againn I guess a very small chance they could be implicated but one would think I’d have urinary retention or urgency and frequency. My stools also changed and got thinner at the same time. 

So if feels like there may be just local inflammation or bladder and/ bowels (maybe GI inflammation irritating bladder) or something is attacking my tissue. I have very high blood marker for MMP-9 (I guess involved in tissue remodeling) but the other basic markers to check for inflammation or autoimmunity are normal (ANA,  hlb-27, ESR, CRP). Only other things showing as out of range in the more extensive panels I’ve gotten are super high total IGE (no classic allergy symptoms at all though), high acetylcholine, high EBV titers, and high cortisol (both blood serum and 24 hour). Sporadically out of range WBC. Always trends in high normal but sporadically moves to out of range. High neutrophils (on edge of normal). So maybe my body is still fighting some sort of infection? Even though not showing up on urinalysis or the basic stool tests given by PCP. 

Or maybe I should attempt a more complete workup for autoimmune issue? It looks like lupus can rarely but sometimes present as bladder cystitis and affect kidneys? My kidney function is okay but not as great as you would think it would be for my age, overall health (or at least before this), weight (normal BMI - on thinner side at 5’5 and 105lbs), and risk factors. But kidneys look okay on ultrasound. 

Idk I guess I worry I’m showing early warning signs of something but maybe it just hasn’t gotten full blown enough to be fully detectable or diagnosable? The bladder and back pain are fairly crippling though. 

Sorry this is a long dissertation but thought I’d check to see if you think it might be worth it or other tests I should try. I’m basically bed ridden working 10-12 hours a day from a desk bed setup and then otherwise in hot bath or lying with heating pads while my poor husband has to watch me struggle and he has to postpone enjoying his life too or opt out of normal life things we used to do since I can’t really travel, play tennis with him anymore, eat normal meals (to try to see if strict diet can help bladder), etc.",1

,,,,"Warning, this is a little long, but I don't know how to make this shorter.. 

NAD but just an FYI, if the Lyrica (pregabalin) doesn't seem to be helping after you have been on a therapeutic level for a while, you may want to try gabapentin. I'm thinking your Lyrica may have to go up some to get to the level where they say it isn't working for you. I also have an autoimmune disorder (Psoriatic Arthritis) and I take gabapentin. I'm not sure it is working that well for me so my doc and I are going to change me to Lyrica in the near future and try that. I had a blood infection a couple of months ago and was in the hospital and we want to wait until I am on therapeutic levels of my biologic again before switching anything.

For many people it seems that both Lyrica and gabapentin are the kind of meds that you really don't feel like they are working, but if you have to stop them, you realize they were helping. From numerous people I know that are on one or the other of the two meds, it also seems like one may work for them but the other doesn't. My cousin tried Lyrica and it didn't work for her but gabapentin did. I have another cousin that was just the opposite. With a new autoimmune diagnosis it can also take a while of ups and downs until you get to the levels of meds that are right for you. I wish I had done what I'm about to tell you when I was first diagnosed, but you really should keep a pain diary right now because you are on several new meds. Also if things are working well for you, make sure your doc does what mine did.. Only change one med at a time. If you change (stop/add a med, up/lower a dosage amount) of more than one at a time, it's hard to tell which one worked/didn't work. It can be a hard process in the beginning because there are so many changes at once with all the new meds but once you get everything where it needs to be, lupus can be controlled and you are very fortunate that they diagnosed you at your age. That means they can prevent damage that happens when it takes a lot time to get a diagnosis. I wish I had been diagnosed that early in life because I've already had a lot of joint damage. Also lupus can damage your kidneys so it is great they diagnosed yours at your age.

Make sure your rheumatologist does frequent blood work (many don't) because some od your meds and/or disease can do some liver and/or kidney damage so they need to keep a watch on that. My doc does my blood work every 3 to 4 months.

Something else that is really important for the plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) can cause damage to your eyes so you need to see an eye doctor regularly. Not an optometrist, but an ophthalmologist. It is preferable to see one that deals with autoimmune disorders and the medications required to treat them. Also with any autoimmune disorder, a lot of people will have a second one. Many will get uveitis, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the eyes. The problems that you could have with your eyes while taking plaquenil are problems that the ophthalmologist would see before you have symptoms of a problem. You must go at least yearly and your eye doc may suggest you do it more often. The good thing about that is your insurance should pay for those eye exams even when basic eye exams aren't covered by insurance, since this is a medical issue and not a regular eye exam. Just don't let that go if your doc doesn't tell you that you need it. You do. You can Google ""plaquenil and eye exams"" and you will find you must do this.

If you have any questions for someone dealing daily with an autoimmune disorder, please feel free to contact me. Just DM me and I will be glad to help you with dealing with this day to day. Even though I have a different autoimmune disorder, there are a lot of similarities with many of them, especially ones that are inflammatory arthritis, which lupus and psoriatic arthritis both are. I know you don't feel fortunate right now because you have been diagnosed with a chronic illness, but you are so very fortunate they caught it when you are 23 instead is when you are 43 and have tons of damage and even worse pain. I also find that weed helps my pain more than anything, but my current pain doc doesn't allow it (my old one did). Once you get to therapeutic levels of the medication cocktail that is right for you, your pain won't stop but it will get better and easier to control.

Good luck! Don't forget you can contact me anytime!

ETA: You really need to talk to your doc about the daily prednisone. I realize that sometimes we all have to take it (personally I find the medrol dose pack works better for me and you take it less than a week). Prednisone is not a benign medication. There are numerous issues that can come from daily pred or even taking it a lot but not daily, at the dosage you are taking. You are already on two medications (plaquenil and imuran) that lower your immune system (which autoimmune disorders require) and prednisone is a third. You can get serious infections. If there is anyway you can not take prednisone every day, that would be great and better for you. It may be that your doctor is planning on lowering your pred after some of your other meds get to therapeutic levels. Just be aware, prednisone can help a lot with pain but it can cause some serious problems, so be sure and discuss the pred with your doctor and find out what their plan is for taking that. Please try to work with your doctor to not have to take it regularly if possible.",4

Then I got pneumonia and the symptoms/abnormal lab flood gates opened that allowed for a definite diagnosis. Hindsight is 20/20. 

To be fair, what systemic lupus actually is like vs what we read about in textbooks is nowhere near comparable. Makes it extremely hard to diagnose.

However, it has also disabled me so I can’t help as many as I had anticipated. With every yin, there is a Yang so to speak.",5
