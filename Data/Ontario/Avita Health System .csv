Mine has been nothing less than amazing. Having everything already on file is convenient and time saving. I love the fact I have the ability to see multiple specialist and not having to provide all of my medical information every time. Plus the fact they use mychart is amazing all of my doctors and medical history is right there. Avita has so many specialist, doctors and services that it is rare to have to go anywhere outside of the Avita health system."

My experience was GREAT!  I arrived and was greeted  by a friendly young lady who took my name and birthday and grabbed me a wheelchair. I had injured my calf, but was not in acute pain. She took me to a room without delay where my nurse joined us moments later. She checked vital signs, got my story and chief complaint and told me who my providers would be. The PA arrived not 5 minutes later, did a thorough exam and explained the tests he thought were indicated. The very friendly registration clerk came in to verify/update my records and then the Ultrasound Tech and X-ray Tech each arrived to get my testing done in my room. The PA returned to my room, gave me my diagnosis and asked if I needed pain meds to go home. I was given a knee immobilizer and crutches and the nurse went over my discharge instructions and put my knee brace on for me. She then escorted me to my car to make sure that I could get in it with the brace on and that I was confident that I could drive myself home. My entire visit was <90 minutes.  I never actually spoke with a doctor, but felt as though my care was exceptional."

Student PA was clueless and kept talking about the pain in her knee. She never complained about pain in her knee. Then he came back twice to verify what leg it was. They took an xray and ""didn't see anything"". No kidding, and MRI would have made more sense. The actual NP said an MRI would show more accurately whats going on, but doesn't think she needs one tonight. WTH? Told us if it gets worse, contact the specialist. Then the discharge girl comes in, but she came in the wrong room. She was looking for Heather. Only bright spot was the nurse who explained very clearly to us some questions we had. Kudos to him. What's the point of hospitals if you're not gonna treat serious injuries?"

I barely sat down in waiting room when I was taken back for my lab work. I think her name was Judy and she was also very friendly and efficient.

She told us that he needed to follow up with a neurologist, and sent us home with discharge instructions stating to call neurology and schedule an appointment ASAP. When we called neurology they didn’t have the referral, called the ER back twice to get the referral pushed through, still nothing, when we called neurology back they said they still had not gotten the referral, and brushed off the issue stating that he just needed to see a PCP, even though they did not actually see him."

The Dr had a very lazy uncaring attitude! The nurse named Gabby was exceptional and I just loved her. I don’t think this Dr had a clue in the world and his name is Stephen Escue. He gave off a very bad vibe that just didn’t sit well with me! What he said and what my MyChart said didn’t match. My MyChart basically said that it was my gallbladder but he said it was my liver metastasis which is from having stage 4 breast cancer. Even the nurse wasn’t buying what he stated but like she said she’s not a Dr and can’t diagnose. I read between the lines.

I've had my cdl for 7 years and she is the first and only care provider to ever recommend a sleep test even my PCP Dr Haus has never shown concern or even mentioned it to me. I show no symptoms, or concerns of sleep apnea besides my BMI. I'm very disappointed in her professionalism and lack of respect to her patients.

Like many others that left reviews, I also thought that the nurses and front desk staff went above and beyond to try and take care of me. They did their blood draw and tests and made me feel safe and heard... However, the doctor that I spoke with was not helpful at all. She firstly was rather stand-off-ish and seemed to be trying to keep her distance from me rather than trying to help. I discussed my issues with her and she left and came back and the things she said on her second visit strongly implied that she hadn't listened to a word I had said. She then goes on to tell me that all my tests came back completely normal and that she would refer me to a specialist in the same hospital to try for a better diagnosis. After THREE DAYS of going back and forth with the nurses and the specialist trying to get the referral ro go through I finally just gave up. I am still experiencing the same issues as before, I have missed time (and money) from work, and now I also have this ridiculous bill to pay all for them not to help in the slightest. I will never go back to Avita."

My visit started with registration, and the lady who got me registered was personable, efficient, and thoughtful. She got me registered for bloodwork, x-ray, and an EKG. The lady from the lab promptly got me from the waiting area. She was so personable as well! She also was very skilled in her modality. When she was finished she escorted me to imaging. I gave my labels to the lady at registration there and she immediately called over to cardiology to see if they wanted me right after the x-ray. Someone came and got me for the x-ray after a very short wait. Once that was finished she escorted me to cardiology where someone was ready for the EKG. The EKG was done before I knew it, and the kind lady who did that made sure to walk me all the way back to the exit to the lobby. Everyone was so nice and helpful, as well as so efficient with their time."

My husband has to come to do COPD problems. But tonight. We brought him in after the second day of being here. They just sat him in the hall and ignored him. He was wheezing and having a real hard time. They should have more then one e.r Dr and be able to treat someone til they can see a Dr.  Four hour waits for most people is not acceptable especially if there in breathing stays problems.

A blonde with glasses comes out a room and I give my name and why I am there. She states she has me and sit in waiting area. I pre-registered so I sat in waiting area. An hour latter I ask how long it will be. 2 students advise they will find out for me. Finally a rad tech comes out and questions me. I give her the story and by the time they take me back I have now waited 1 1/2 hours.
I think avita needs to have clear signage advising where to go and advise where reception is if imaging has no reception."

Once I got in I sat there for almost 3 hours to see a doctor for less than 3 minutes. She didn't seem to care about the problems I was having, and come across as condescending. They gave me an ibuprofen and sent me home. Did not give me any reassurance about the problems I've been having for the last 3-4 weeks. With everything else in mind the other nurses, practitioners, and RN were very kind and sweet to me, but seeing the initial doctor for such a short period of time and for her to barely look at me was very frustrating. Could have been because I don't have insurance, or because she thought my problem was insignificant. I expressed I was having tooth pain that had since been helped with antibiotics and felt like it could have been associated with that. I believe it could be a strain or pull, but the feeling is different than a strain I've had before. Her barely looking at me and kind of shrugging me off did not give me piece of mind and left a sour taste in my mouth. I could've been more persistent, but I didn't want to get seen by someone who didn't seem to care/didn't have the time to waste on something that may seem minor to her."

I had to look up the side effects and all information on it myself. Then I had to return the next day for an allergic reaction, sharp abdominal pain and bleeding issues from taking the Prednisone. They gave me a shot of benadryl and didn't do any further testing to check for internal damage, despite the fact that I specifically requested it.

Instead they did xrays and lied to us. The Dr said the blood work showed Gout, NO ONE CAME IN TO TAKE THE BLOOD. So we wanted to know how the blood work showed it. I called the next day and told them about the experience. They apologized. Then we got the bill. I should not have to pay for lies. Plus such a long wait. Now I have no idea where to go or what hospital to trust. It's really sad."

When I asked where my child was at that was just brought into the ED this little man said he had no record of this person in the hospital. I asked if there was someone else I could talk to that could help and he rolled his eyes and rudely replied, “who do you want to talk to?” I told him I wanted someone who would actually help me find my child and walked away.

As someone who works with hospitals every single day in a professional capacity I am absolutely appalled that someone at the front desk of a hospital would behave this way to someone who is worried about the well-being of their child. I only wonder if this attitude is endemic to this facility. I will not return to this facility unless faced with a life threatening situation."

They did not even look at the stuff I told him was wrong and I know I have broken ribs from another specialist directly after leaving this facility and the doctor there was a male older gentleman did not even touch me I had a release report from them talking about contusions and how you can't see broken ribs through a layer of dried blood needless to say I went all the way through the visit just so I could write this review this was absolutely the most horrible experience I've ever had at any doctors emergency rooms or care physicians. I do not recommend not even one star and I do not recommend taking your dogs to this facility let alone your children or yourself.

Biggest problem is intake for labs. Layout not great but staff really tries to get you checked in and serviced. A bit more time needed to iron the wrinkles. Food service is very good especially for a hospital. Most dishes are prepped fresh when ordered. As a patient and as a companion to a patient I'd rate the food as very good.

A man recently called me and stated I had been to Avita 11 times in the last 2 years and owed all this money impossible but ok. Next out of the 3 times I have went the man in the ER doing MRI's blew my views 2 separate times essentially making me do 3 separate MRI's. Which they charged me for, the nurse told me I had diverticulitis and prescribed vicodine to which the pharmacy never got. I then developed a rash and severe pain which they indicated I should return if any changes. I went back 1 week later to discover I actually had shingles they then wouldn't give me anything for pain because I was already ""prescribed"" vicodine supposedly. Now my wages are being garnished for 8900 dollars because I had shingles. Worst hospital I have ever came acrossed. That's not my only awful experience with Avita. I'd recommend ohio health any day."

2-20-23 @ around 4:30pm. The experience was not good.  I went in for a burn and one of the help on duty put a band-aid on one of my bubbled burn🤦‍♀️🤨 and the nurse practitioner on duty said she called in a prescription for me and when I got to my pharmacy, she had not done so. So I had to call the emergency room and the nurse practitioner says she will call it in when she gets a minute 😳. Really!!
I dont recommend this place."

I showed up at 9:45, with new patient paperwork in hand all filled out, and sat in the waiting area until almost 10:30 before I was taken back to a room and checked-in. It was 11:00 and nobody had been in the room. I decided at that point I was leaving as I have to use my sick time from work for this visit and it was clearly getting wasted. I told the lady in check out that I was leaving and all she said was ""ok"". I stopped at reception and explained why I was leaving and asked for my co-pay to be refunded. The receptionist went and talked to the check-out lady and came back to refund my copay, and all she said was ""thank you""!!!! Not one apology from any staff or the Dr. herself as at this point she was standing at the check-out. I understand that she has a busy and demanding job, but come on, at least let your patients know what's going on & that you're running behind to see if they need to reschedule."

They kept saying that they was waiting for a bed for them at Riverside so why didn't they put them in a room here until they got them one at Riverside?? I wish that I hadn't deleted the pictures I took of the surgine that they left one the counter or the vile that was also left there that had pain meds in it so agents the law I thought the room had not been cleaned in the 5 days that they was there. I have never seen a hospital this bad before. And believe me ours ain't the best but compared to this one I would give ours a five. This one gets a 1. And when you can't give someone an ensure you say that you don't have it and you asked us to bring them some from home that is really bad.
