I’ve had many surgeries in my life, probably 10, plus family members who have been hospitalized for various reasons, ie, heart attacks etc., so I feel I am a decent judge of our local and downtown Toronto hospitals and the treatment received in them.
I felt compelled to write this review as I’ve never been treated so kindly, and with respect, as I was just now, by each and every staff member of this Hospital.  From volunteers to the Drs., everyone working there was smiling, enjoying their jobs and coworkers. It was such a refreshing change from my previous experiences elsewhere.
I was able to recover quickly, safely, while having the most wonderful team watching out for my best interests at all times.
My heartfelt thanks goes out to each and every single member of the staff that were involved in my surgery and 7th floor, recovery process afterwards."

Was never told how serious it was until the end. Was told two days before my dear Mom passed that she ""may"" have Cancer. And why did the Dr wait until the day of her passing for the ultrasound on her leg when she was advised of how she had pain 2 days earlier, which turned out to be a blood clot. Some nurses complained about changing my mom as they were very short staffed. Sorry they were so inconvenienced. We're all just a number at this hospital. My beautiful Mom is gone.

Everyone in the hospital was courteous, professional and helpful. There are people all over to guide if you get lost. The hospital looked squeaky clean, not crowded and structured well. Their washrooms were clean as well.

The ultrasound specialist was very kind and patient with my kid. She suggested what to do next and was helpful. Plenty of parking, so no need to waste time looking for a spot.

I am giving 4 stars because the lady who called me to book an appointment for an ultrasound, didn’t give me the address, didn’t give me the name of the place, didn’t give me any instructions on what to do, how to arrive and if there are any formalities to follow. She just rushed through a phone call saying your daughter has an appointment and then gave me time, disconnected before even I asked a question. They can be a little more patient and provide instructions for patients to come in.

They also have food court and gift shops which I found were very good. I would go back here again if there is a need."

My doctor is Norgaard but he was never on call when I delivered because of the schedule yet he’s a great doctor. The only major difference in both deliveries is the epidural doctor (anesthesiologist) - the first time was a lady and to be honest it felt like I didn’t get one the pain was very strong but the second time it was a male doctor who was very tall and the epidural definitely made the whole difference. Unfortunately I forgot his name. Good luck to all mamas and congrats!

As I went back upstairs, I was assured by my floor doctor that as soon as the note gets upstairs from the urologist, which should be a little later, I would be given my prescription and discharged.
As I am writing this review, it has been 28 hours since the test and the note has not been received. I have talked to 3 nurses, a doctor and left a message for a Patient Relations, whose voice mail starts by saying that her vm is not monitored. What does that even mean?

Child was illegally told that she could not wait outside with parent ('illegally' because child had not been properly admitted or required to stay over-night).

I am disgusted at how this ""hospital"" treats(or mistreats)  minors/ children.

My child entered the 'brief assessment service', zone f room 1-w-c16b.  (I) Parent was asked to leave, child did not want that.  Child was told that she had to stay (even though child had not been admitted)

This hospital knowingly & willingly held my child against her wishes & the parents wishes.

We came here seeking medical services. We left after receiving verbal abuse, illegal detaining of a child, and complete disregard of the patient's depressive state.

First off, I get everyone is working long hours and it can be a stressful having to deal with patients and caretakers, but can we please show some patience and empathy. You would think they'd be trained considering it is the ""mental health"" unit. But no, most (not all) of the nurses are really rude and so uncooperative.

Reasons why this place horrendous.

1. There is 0 coordination between the BASU and the Mental Health Unit. This is the same hospital and for some reason they don't have a system which allows them to know when there is going to be incoming patients. So you are out here waiting to visit your loved one and all they say is ""they have a different system we don't know"" and proceeds to shout at you as if it's your fault for not understanding that.

2. I've called multiple times in regards to understanding how my loved one was doing and the treatment they are getting and medication they are taking, and every single time they say ""we aren't able to give it to you"" which I get because patient confidentiality, however they promised to have a consent form signed which I've asked for multiple times, and there is NEVER a follow-up. It seems they make every effort to make impossible for caretakers to know what's going on.

3. This unit is miserable there is very little amenities and looks slightly better than a jail cell. There's nothing bright or lively or joyful, no videogames, barely any boardgames or books. No comfy seats or places to exercise.

Please do a better job at communicating with caretakers so that they can be a part of the treatment plan. Please take time and actually improve the patient care here!"

They didn't even remove the bracelet and they didn't check his oxygenation.

I say deny given the fact that they take you in for having a ""mental crisis"", but if you do not want to act on suicide at that singular moment, it is their job to get rid of you asap with follow-ups.

Two nights ago I had a horrific mental episode: I did not want to schedule a therapist to wait for 2 weeks because my episode was happening right then and there. I wanted to consult someone immediately without followups so I came to Trafalgar Memorial Hospital hoping to get help. Instead, I was led into a room (one that literally looked like a crazy asylum from a Hollywood film) followed by a woman who literally interrogated me and was getting questions out of me in a very uncomftorable manner and was not respectful of my mental state. I had a difficult time answering her questions. I have never felt so belittled. This woman would have been great in police stations, not mental health wards. She left me all alone in that scary room where I started screaming and crying out of fear of what was to happen to me next. Then she came back with prescription medication and a follow-up. In other words, it was the hospital telling me politely that I wasn’t a patient of interest and I was wasting their time.

I understand having suicide as your focus of immediate mental intervention. I really do. But you should rename your unit to ""suicide prevention"" if your focus is just that. If you are a mental health ward like your website says you are, you should be more accommodating of diverse mental health experiences beyond suicide. Suicide is not the only mental health catastrophe there is. Thank you for the effort to help. But I would have been so much better off without this experience."

Upon my arrival, I noticed a lengthy queue for triage. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional care and attention provided by the lady at the registration desk. She diligently monitored each individual in the queue and promptly assisted a man who appeared unwell, ensuring he received a wheelchair and necessary support. She also made sure to check on the well-being of everyone waiting. Her warm smile and genuine concern were truly commendable.

I was promptly attended to after the initial assessment. A compassionate nurse named Ruby provided exceptional care throughout my visit. Despite her multitasking responsibilities, she consistently ensured my comfort and never made me feel like a burden. She effectively managed to calm me down and empathized with my pain. When she noticed a change in my speech, she acted swiftly and took immediate action, potentially saving my life.

Although I do not recall the name of the doctor who attended to me, I will never forget her remarkable kindness and professionalism. It is rare to encounter doctors who exhibit such genuine compassion and attentiveness. Despite the chaotic environment in the emergency room, she never rushed me during the assessment and patiently listened to all my concerns. Her motherly approach provided immense comfort during a scary situation.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to these exceptional individuals who truly made a positive impact on my experience. Their dedication and care are truly commendable.

They make a difference in the face of healthcare. I hope this message reaches them🩷"

I visited the emergency room due to severe hip pain without any known injuries. My pain level was unimaginable, far exceeding a 10 on the pain scale—I described it as ""200"" during triage. Despite this, I was informed that the wait time would be around 5 hours. In reality, I was left waiting for a staggering 12 hours before I was seen by a doctor.

Even the doctor who came in during the night shift was shocked that I had been left unattended for so long, yet there was no explanation given for this delay.

During my wait, I approached the nurses to inquire when I would be seen. The responses I received were both apathetic and disrespectful, which is completely unacceptable in healthcare. When I asked about the hospital’s triage system, I was told that this information was confidential and that I was not entitled to know it. This lack of transparency only added to the frustration and sense of helplessness.

After four days of admission, with two of those days spent sitting in a room with minimal attention, I was finally diagnosed with a serious condition that required emergency medical intervention. Shockingly, during the night shift, I was repeatedly denied care by the on-call doctor despite the urgency of my condition.

This hospital’s negligence, disrespectful staff behavior, and blatant disregard for patient care pose serious risks to public safety. I believe this facility should be reported to both the College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Ministry of Health for a thorough investigation. Their practices are not only inefficient but dangerous to those in need of timely medical intervention."

There is a reason it is rated 3 stars on google. First off my partner and I experienced 3 separate occasions of abuse from the staff on the same day!! In the mental health ward of course. A nurse tried calling me with my partner on the line who is experiencing psychosis and wanting to rinse my insurance for everything we got. They are confrontational, physically get up in your face, and the entire nursing team is in on it together. This isn’t a mental health ward it’s a gang. Escalate an issue? They’ll play games all day. I had to email the director of patient care and patient relations as well as make a complaint to the college of ontario nurses in addition to seeking legal action for my complaint to be seriously looked at. For anyone who has been seriously mistreated here. You must chase them and hold them accountable for their actions. Their internal teams will slap them on the wrist. That’s why there are so many stories of abuse here. There is something rotten in this institution. Do yourself a favour and go to CAMH instead. Do not take your loved ones here. I have been through 5 hospitalizations now with my partner and this has been the most traumatizing one. These people shouldn’t be allowed to practice in my opinion. Absolutely shameful behaviour. A lot of retraining needs to happen to bring the standard of care up here."

And yes, the wait time was long (>4hrs) but we would have been such a low priority I wasn't surprised at all. The cut was small and only required 2 staples to get the bleeding to stop, so I knew we'd be waiting a bit. I just want to say, all of the staff we interacted with were just lovely. The nurses were so good with my daughter, making her feel comfortable even in such a new environment, and the doctor was quick with the staples and friendly and answered all of my questions about how to care for the wound afterwards. I really wish I could remember anyone's names, but overall I was just very impressed with how good they were with my daughter, she didn't get scared at all and honestly probably actually had fun with the whole experience, which is crazy. Thank you to the ER staff for helping us out last night!"

Was in the psych ward experiencing drug induced psychosis, and was laughed at by a team of doctors behind a pane of glass for my odd behaviour. I felt like an animal in a zoo. But I'm glad the doctors could at least gain amusement from one of the worst days of my life.

Psychiatrist Jeremy Butler is a cold, condescending bully, who DENIED my alcoholism to my family doctor, actively making it harder to seek treatment (this was before a two month stint in rehab). He will gaslight you about symptoms, insult you, and dehumanize you. He is completely unfit to be working with mentally ill people, and poses an active threat to their wellbeing. These people made it actively hard to seek treatment for my mental health issues every step of the way. Others clearly share my concern."

Whilst waiting to see a doctor in the emergency department (after midnight and about 4 hours waiting) my wife, who is sick enough to warrant enduring the long wait times, was trying to rest and fell asleep on the floor. The security guard woke my wife as she was in the way of any emergency paramedics, which we agree is totally valid.

However, the tone and condescension he took when demanding she move, as it was in his words “totally unacceptable”, was disgusting, incredibly rude and quite frankly reeked of misogony.

As a patient, curled up in the fetal position on the floor whilst waiting to be seen by a doctor in the emergency department, it’s utterly unacceptable to be spoken to in the manner he spoke to my wife.

The irony of the situation being my wife was lying underneath a ‘mutual respect’ poster… I guess this security guard missed that memo.

A little compassion goes a long way, especially in a hospital… I hope this security guard is given some customer service training or moved to a non patient-interactive station."

During a recent visit to see my mother, a cancer patient, we encountered extremely rude and inconsiderate behavior from a cleaning staff member named Ava.

Ava slammed doors, yelled while speaking, and even confronted my aunt, demanding in a raised voice that she change the spoiled linen bag. She also made inappropriate comments and, when asked to stop yelling, pointed her finger at me and said, “I don’t have compassion for you or your family.”

This behavior is unprofessional and highly insensitive, especially in a hospital setting where patients and families are already under significant stress. It is shocking to witness such blatant disregard for compassion and respect.

I urge Oakville Trafalgar Hospital to address this matter and ensure all staff, including cleaning personnel, are reminded of the importance of empathy and professionalism in their interactions with patients and their families. This incident undermines the trust and confidence that patients and their families place in this institution."

They spend millions on a fancy food court to be like a mall, but don't hire any doctors to work the over night shift. They leave people in pain in there for hours. The amount of people I saw suffering while my fiancee waited for her turn took well over 8 hours. It wasn't busy, and there were no patients coming in after us. This place is an absolute waste of tax dollars.
EDIT**** came here because we had go for the birth of our daughter. And we're force to stay here for 3 days when nothing was wrong. They ran our bill up through the roof. Between parking and having to pay for a room for my wife and daughter to be in. I wasn't aware we live in the USA. Why does this multi billion dollar hospital need to make that much more money of new parents? Garbage waste of this sized facility. They only work from 10am-6pm.

I am giving NO STARS for the so-called "" triage"" process.  I have not been to the emergency department for at least 25 years.  I arrived at 2 pm on Tuesday.  My husband went to park the car.  There was a lineup with about 6 people in front of me.  The volunteer Joan ( 6 stars for Joan and her kindness) brought me a chair as she saw I was about to collapse.   I was in extreme pain from what I suspected and later confirmed was a kidney stone.   Now, for those of you who have never had a kidney stone,  the pain was worse than when I gave birth, drug free.  Joan could see my pain and went to triage to let them know, but no one responded.  I was shaking,  sweating, and barely coherent.  My husband had to hold my head and was doing his best to comfort me.  Slowly, the line moved, and we were finally called in by a triage nurse.  At this point, my pain is close to unbearable, and I am spread eagle in the chair with my head back, again, sweating and shaking.  My husband tells me she barely looked at me with no acknowledgment of my obvious pain.  She asked questions and typed like a robot.  We were then asked to wait in a small area for the nurse who attaches the hospital bands.  We were called in by her, and she asked my husband if I was usually cold, clamy, and sweaty?  ( now remember, I am spread eagle on the chair head back and barely coherent). My husband held his anger and responded, "" Obviously not. She is in extreme pain.""  Hospital bands are attached, and we are sent back to the small waiting area to await blood work.  I barely remember this happening.   Bloodwork is now done, and  we are taken into the ER waiting area.  My husband leaves my chart in the basket, and we wait.  My pain is unrelenting, so my husband approaches the nursing station to find out about pain meds.  We must wait for a nurse to be assigned.   We are finally taken to a bed in the hallway.  A nurse inserts an IV while I am about to vomit from the pain.  He was amazing.  Soon, another nurse ( also amazing) gave me a dose of toradol, and within half an hour, my pain is controlled.  This is more than 2 hours since arriving at emergency.  The staff in the ER were fantastic.  I am relaying this experience because I want to know why you call it ""triage"" when it is obviously just a lineup.   I worked in pharmacy for 30 years.  I know the system is broken, and healthcare professionals are drained.   I know how difficult it can be dealing with patients.  I had to retire early myself from burnout.  I get it.  I don't expect special treatment, hand holding, or coddling.  I understand about the wait, and I waited quietly, relieved to be out of pain, BUT to ignore someone at triage in that kind of pain is inhumane."

They were very pleasant and took the time to listen to our concerns and obtain feedback for future improvement. This doesn't change our experience, however, I hope it changes the experience for future families.

Pediatrician tried to forcefully perform a lumbar puncture on my 3 week old infant prior to completing other testing to investigate further, with only a 1% chance of the LP being required. After 3 separate opinions from 2 other pediatricians and family doctor following us arguing our way to be discharged, the lumbar puncture was not recommended or required in our sons case. This is an invasive and painful procedure that we have been advised should only be performed as a last resort and under certain criteria which our son did not meet requirements for. After proper steps were followed, we were able to obtain a proper diagnosis and treatment plan at Joseph Brant without the lumbar puncture.

This is following a 9.5 hour total duration at OMTH where they waited to discuss results for 6 hours after receiving them, but suddenly it was a rush to complete this procedure without retesting the following day which we did at Joseph Brant and it turned out to be the right way to go. Sounds like someone gets a kick back for performing surgery and wanted a payday.

Do not take your babies to this hospital and do not always trust the first recommendation given when faced with invasive procedures. We trusted our gut and thankful we did not put our newborn through added pain and potential complications for no reason."

The individual responsible for the initial evaluation displayed a level of rudeness and insensitivity that was not only surprising but deeply unsettling. Her mannerisms were, at best, insulting, and it was disheartening to encounter such behavior, especially in a setting where individuals seek urgent medical attention and support.

Customer service, particularly in healthcare, is vital, and encountering a professional in this field who falls short of demonstrating empathy and respect is disconcerting. It is important for frontline staff in emergency departments to handle situations with care, considering the often stressful and vulnerable state of those seeking assistance.

While I understand that everyone may have challenging days, a role in customer service, especially in healthcare, requires a level of compassion and understanding. If this individual finds it challenging to uphold these principles, it may be worth considering alternative roles where her skills and demeanor align more appropriately.

I hope that this feedback reaches the appropriate channels within the hospital management to address and rectify the lapse in customer service standards. Every patient, irrespective of the circumstances, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and it is crucial to maintain a supportive and caring environment in emergency departments.

I sincerely hope that my experience was an isolated incident and that steps are taken to ensure that others do not encounter similar situations in the future. The overall reputation of the healthcare facility depends on the professionalism and compassion of its staff, and I trust that necessary actions will be taken to address this issue promptly."

I found myself in need of ER services recently and I was met with such a great level of care and compassion from the greeter, and all the nurses and doctors in Zone B. I was there for about 9 hours, but was able to get an x-ray, ultrasound and diagnosis for the acute, debilitating pain I was experiencing. I'm forever grateful to the staff at OTMH for making me feel like a guest rather than just a number. Thank you for your collective dedication to restoring health and wellness with patience, kindness and grace."

I’m shocked that I was taken care of so quickly, which can only be a testament to the folks at Trafalgar Memorial (since, as we all know, healthcare is being brutally underfunded right now—please remember this at the polls). All staff I interacted with were brilliant; special thanks to the second triage nurse I spoke to, who was so, so friendly, and the doctor I saw—Dr. Welters, I think?—for her sense of humour. It probably takes massive strength of character to be so upbeat during a night in the emergency room. Flowers. 💐"

I went today for the same issue - I have been in antagonizing pain with a swollen infected throat due to a Peritonsillar Abscess. In 2016 after seeing multiple doctors at walk-in clinics, along with visits to 2 other major hospitals that I wont name, I decided to come to Oakville. After being admitted, I got to see the ENT specialist that was on call ( Dr Jack Kolenda ). To this day, I still tell people he saved my life. Dr Kolenda took the time to listen to what I’ve been through, asked the right questions and performed the appropriate tasks. It wasn’t long before he ordered a CT Scan, and saw exactly what was going on. That same day, he performed a draining process on my throat and saved my life. I’m forever grateful. It’s amazing what type of impact you can have on someone’s life just by doing the right things !
Today I was back for the same thing unfortunately, 8 years later. Dr Kolenda is no longer there, which I knew ( because I recently needed to find an ENT for my 4 year older daughter who needed ear tubes put in due to reoccurring ear infections, and called Dr Kolenda’s office ). Dr Kolenda’s office was nice enough to refer me to another ENT. I was sad to learn he no longer does this type of work, but since I had such a great experience here 8 years ago, I decided to come back.
From check-in at triage, to registration, to the nurses that did my blood work / IV treatment, and the two doctors that I spoke with - I must say I was genuinely happy with my visit. No one enjoys going to the hospital, but I was in and out in a timely manner and dealt with accordingly.
I didn’t get to see an ENT today, but have a referral to get checked out this week, which I will be doing with Dr Florence Mok at her clinic down the road.
If you were/are hesitant about going to the hospital, I hope you read this - and give it a try.
Hope this helps."

They leave her in a wheel chair till 4am! No check, no vitals until another patient asks for he a recliner.... And why the wait you ask? Well until another patient asked @5am, they find out there are no DRs. They didn't choose to inform anyone of that and let them know. She decides to wait it out for the next Dr @7am! Only to be dismissed and sent home. The patients will care about you cause they're all going through the same thing."

In the Spring, my 5 year old son was rushed by ambulance to the Oakville hospital for a life threatening emergency. It was a horrific of course, but all of the staff were absolutely amazing. He was taken in immediately and given top notch care. He almost had to be transferred to a pediatric ICU but thankfully stabilized and was able to stay and be admitted in Oakville.
The nurses took great care of him while he was there, and he even had a therapy dog come to visit him which I thought was really cool. Thank you!"

When I returned for my follow up, I tried to talk about what happened to the doctor but she gaslit me and then got angry and defensive and stormed out of the room. I spoke to management but nothing came of it.

It is disgusting how doctors traumatize women with zero care and no repercussions. I was too embarrassed about what happened to pursue it then, but I will speak out now in the hopes that other women won't have to endure what I did."

I couldn’t sit/walk as it was too excruciating. The check in at 11 pm was quick. The issue was at the waiting area. There were so many nurses just sitting there and gossiping etc. I was in tears and kept on saying the pain was too much but they just asked me to keep on waiting. There was just 1 doctor and 8-10 nurses. There were some other patients who came after me with broken leg/hand and were given priority which I totally understand. After several reminders, I was given a room around 2 am and a doctor only visited me around 4.30 am. He came, quickly pushed my leg and said its Sciatica. Gave me 2 medicines (Naproxen and Morphine) and left. He did not do any other test or understood the severity of my pain. Just said go to your family doctor. Seems like he was irritated that why did I even go to emergency. I have been in extreme pain even after the medicine he gave. I went to my family doc who gave me second round of heavy dose medicine which did not work and then he gave me 2 painkiller shots to reduce some pain and send me for x-ray.

Some requests:
(1) I really want to request these nurses and doctors to show some empathy. People are not enjoying coming to Emergency. (2) I also want to ask the authorities why they cannot have 2 doctors during night time and reduce the no of nurses to 4 or 6 in Emergency. (3) Why was my pain just ignored although I said that my pain level is 9/10. Why no imaging etc. was done to understand the severity.

I request all of you at the hospital to please please be considerate with people even if its very normal for you to see these issues on a daily basis. Hope some action is taken to make this a better place."

However, I severely think that the management of this Hospital should reconsider there positions before I'd recommend a defunding of its funds.

On Sep 5th +/- 9PM I rushed my partner to the hospital after finding out she was in anaphylactic shock caused by an allergy.

The symptoms were extremely clear and present, and she was on the verge of becoming unresponsive.

Not only did the initial intake ignore her symptoms, they also made her wait for +/- 40 minutes before even considering taking her in (keep in mind, no other higher emergency was taking place at the time in that room (by the looks of it).

After noting her info and taking some blood, we were sent to the next general admission waiting room for further treatment. So far it had taken around +/- 1,5 hours, whilst still in anaphylactic shock which had been going on for 2 hours at that point.

The general admission waiting room was the definition of unprofessional and incompetent behavior: we set down for +/- 1,5 hours before she had her BPM and pressure checked just to wait another 1,5 hours with no regards to her condition.

When asked to take place in a private room after 4 hours of waiting, we addressed that we'd like to see a female physician for personal reasons. This was taken personally, which was noticeable by the body language and agitated responses from the administration.

The one thing that stuck to me most was explaining to the young administration lady that we'd been up since 4AM (at the time of telling it was +/- 3.30AM in the morning) and that we had been waiting for nearly 5 hours at that point. Her response was agitated and said ""so? there's people who've been longer in here than you"".

After this shocking reply, we've waited another 20 minutes for the doctor to arrive after being told we were first in queue, just to find out we were in fact 3rd in queue with no ETA on getting helped.

It was at this point that we had decided to cancel our wait on the doctor and to find another location the next day. The whole experience was infuriating, disappointing, and most of all not helping the health of my partner in any way - in fact, in made it worse.

I highly recommend anyone that needs efficient and proper care to seek help elsewhere, as this hospital clearly needs to get their house in order."

Im deciding to post today because I think that everyone should be aware at what happens here and how staff treats their patients. Upon arrival at the ward, staff checks your bag for anything that could be harmful before giving you your stuff. I had $40.00 cash with my belongings that was STOLEN by staff. I only noticed at discharge. My parents spoke to staff and we were told they would be launching an investigation into it. It’s been three months and I have not received a call back. It is absolutely disgusting and frightening that staff here would steal from patients at a time that they are in need. I dont care about the money, I have already accepted that that money is gone, but it’s about the principle. If they stole cash from me, how many other things are they stealing from patients? Additionally, staff is extremely neglectful and lack the basic human characteristic of empathy, despite their field. I informed them about my dietary restrictions which took them two whole days to accommodate. I was forced to eat a non vegan diet (despite being vegan for over 7 yrs) or starve for those two days. Also, during my stay, there was a patient who had badly hurt her hand (her whole hand was extremely swollen and looked broken) and she was refused medical attention for over 12 hours. This baffled me considering we were literally IN a hospital. Another patient required polygrip for her dentures in order to eat and speak properly. She hassled staff for hours and hours and only was provided it the day after. Aside from all this that I witnessed, in general, staff just straight out ignore you. You can stand in front of the staff station trying to get their attention and they will look at you, look away, and continue whatever the hell they were talking about. Patients had to beg for attention from staff basically. Its really dehumanizing. They dont care about your needs here. The ward just made you feel crazy because of how the staff treat you. You wont be treated as a patient in need of care, youll be treated as an inmate who committed a horrible crime."

I recently went to Oakville Hospital for a hernia repair through the day surgery department.  I was totally amazed at the wonderful care provided to me during the brief stay.  There were many patients lined up at 6 AM for a variety of procedures and everyone was registered with courtesy and efficiency. The staff were very busy but pleasant and caring every step of the way; from check in to pre op, to post op, to discharge.  The recovery instructions were clear and Dr Kealey visited during recovery to make sure I was doing fine and to share the outcome of the procedure.  We are very fortunate to have this excellent facility and staff serving our community.  Thank you.  Robert Bell

I had surgery a week ago at Oakville Hospital and have nothing but very positive things to say about the experience. I was understandably nervous about the procedure but all staff were excellent from when I entered the hospital to when leaving 36 hours later.

They've really set the gold standard of exceptional medical care. They were compassionate, kind, supportive, understanding, knowledgeable, considerate, team players, and critical thinkers. These are just some of qualities that you'd hope to find in your healthcare providers. In the past Ive met doctors and/or nurses who were very invalidating and didn't truly listen to what the patient needed. Rather they just believed in what they knew was best and thus created barriers or gaps in meeting the patients' needs. Personally for me, I believe in a collaborative model of care where patient concerns and needs are taken into consideration to ease communication barriers and further support the care of their health. Sometimes they just need help in seeing the bigger picture or for the care plan to be communicated in order to gain clarity, help promote comfort, reduce stress and alleviate confusion. All in all, I'm happy I chose this hospital to help me through this difficult time. We all need help from time to time in life and when you do need it most, you'd hope that your providers are trustworthy, ethical, responsible and compassionate individuals who will listen to you and validate your experience. We all deserve that at the very least. Everyone has the universal human right to be treated with dignity and compassion. Anything less than ought not to be tolerated. Cant wait to go home and see my babies. We'll see what tomorrow brings. 😉 Thank you again Gani, Li, Katelyn, and Kelly. Y'all are amazing and incredible! Hats off to you four.

I’ve met a lot of great nurses here who have shown compassion for the patients and their job. But in the other hand there’s nurses I’ve met that have fully ignored their patients and just told them to “go away”. It’s insane to see this as a nursing student. I have had no problems with my nurses and none with me. But I did get at least one nurse who simply wasn’t trying to help me.

(I wonder why patients on floors 5/6/7 have to be awakened by these calls?).

Overall, this was the best hospital stay I have had in recent years.  The staff was professional and appeared to have the right experience for my surgery, and was very courteous.   The rooms are very quiet and well designed.  Hygiene protocols were usually adhered to.  Surprisingly, no seemed stressed  or run off their feet and the people who supported me seemed to like their work.

I regretted paying for a private room since you will most likely get one away - they don't have many ward rooms or semi's and in fact even the 4 bed wards look like semi-private."

As someone who has dealt with them, let me give you a piece of advice: do not waste your time, hoping to get any empathy, advocacy and resolution out of them. They're there  to function as a barrier not for advocacy. This hospital must rank very high when it comes to apathy, indifference and poor performance. Halton poured lots of tax money into this hospital to make it a ritzy place. Too bad the money wasn't spent to deliver timely and effective medical care by adequate number of well-trained and well-intended medical and support staff instead of hollow PR and shallow glitz."

Around midnight after 3hrs and a half (note that no one came to check on my belly, do a stress test for the baby either) a nurse came out to say anyone who is not a patient and not with kids has to leave!!! I spoke to her and said this cannot happen, I need my husband with me, I can't go the loo without his help, she doesn't listen and eager to call security which she didn't... And said oh avg wait is 6-7 hours as if this is the thing! I was like you can't even keep up with us, you will come and take me to the loo?!!!  And I don't wanna go with you to pee. I cried and cried and got even more stressed by her attitude  telling me she can't treat me any different!!! 2hrs and half more finally I see a doctor who ordered x-rays, that she didn't even look at cos she told I had a sprain while I had a fracture!!!!

The hospital itself is new and clean. I had a private room with a shower and a couch for my husband to sleep on. There was a touch screen to order food for myself. I thought the food was tasty. Additionally, the hospital food court has plenty of options that my husband could pick for himself.

Everyone in the hospital was courteous, professional and helpful. There's Staff all over to help guide you if you get lost.

The Doctors do their best & we felt that only one if many wasn't up to par.

It would be real easy to base your review on long wait times ( I was there 12 hrs the other day), some overwhelmed Staff, etc.. but the truth is that we are only Human.

My problem is with the ''routine'' diagnostic images that are needing to be done, but are not.

I am just very confused as to why I cannot get my MRI done or my EEG done--the receptionists at both places have stated rather rudely that we will never know when you can get them because they are not doing ANY outpatient imagings. I kind of find that hard to believe, as I have been made aware the Credit Valley are accepting appointments for these things. Just because they are routine, does not mean that they should be pushed aside and that they should not matter. Those tests are done and are needed for a reason, people could die if those are missed. I wish I just had some sort of guidance or understanding or kindness when talking to the bookings staff. I understand the chaos. But, these are important too. Kinder staff, more understanding & just basic explanation would make things a lot easier. I am now switching hospitals for all diagnostic needs.

As soon as you get into the ER the check in desk is right there with absolutely no privacy at all.  Grumpy check in nurse who was snippy with people as I watched her interacting with them, obviously not too happy with her job or being at work sadly.

Check in and triage process was okay and not quick but not to slow either.  Interesting process of how the check you in and send you to different areas depending upon injury etc.   Went in and got a bed fairly quickly for a foot injury (possible broken bone).

Sat in the bed for nearly two hours without a single nurse coming to check up on me or to offer ice, ask if I was okay or needed anything.  They were visibly not busy and could be seen sitting talking while drinking water and coffee during this whole time at their desks.  I get I wasn’t an urgent matter to get to but at least offer me ice or a pillow for my possible broken foot.

Honestly just really disappointed with the lack of empathy and communication skills in general from the staff.  The kicker was also that my sheet on the bed had some gross markings and stains.  Further to the grossness I observed obvious blood on the examination light hanging over me that someone failed to clean properly.

Sad overall with staff and cleanliness.  It is what it is for a hospital but should be much better.

July 17th 2019 - update - still terrible.  Pregnant wife has severe abdominal pains and we go to the doctor who sends us to the hospital.  We go and get chastised by nurse Gayle saying she has no clue what they can do for us.  After 3.5 hours she finally gets seen by the doctor just to find out he wants an ultrasound but they closed at 8pm and she will have to come back tomorrow.  What a joke of a hospital this is."

They were very kind to ask me the previous medications and history of illness. Within 1-2 hours he was stable and moved to ICU. Even in ICU nurses were very helpful and acted what was required and saved us. I am highly grateful to even Paramedic team who performed CPR. I wish this kind of treatment will continue in every hospital."

Most specifically, the team in the NICU went above and beyond our expectations. It takes a special kind of person to work in the NICU and Oakville selected the best. In times of unbearable stress the NICU staff gave us some much needed comfort. We thank you all very much for what you do!"

PATHETIC  parking fee,  and charged .35 cents convenience fee on top.  No one knows what they are doing there.  When trying to find out about your own health when admitted to the hospital no one tells you anything."

Consistently inefficient. Our last several experiences have been nothing short of horrible. Wait times of 8-10 hours, even after being rushed by ambulance. In fact, the last time we had to go to emerg, we went to Hamilton, yet we live almost across the street from otmh. I can assure you, this is not a case of being  short staffed judging from the multiple times seeing groups of staff huddled behind desks having personal discussions, or complaining, or signing birthday cards. They could definitely learn from McMaster which runs like a well oiled machine. Most efficient hospital visit we ever had.
Todays visit, where we actually had one appointment and a requisition for an X-ray for another one of us that said “ no appointment required”,  may have just taken the cake. Terrible!"

We didn't give you one, my mom said what was the blood test for ? The nurse got super rude with my mom and said it's not my responsibility to give you one it's the doctors, I will never come to this hospital ever again, the nurses dont care about anyone but their paychecks and to socialize with there co workers and have a good time, my mom went home with no results, and if something happens to her over night I will be forced to take legal action."

The doctor spent 20 seconds putting on disposable gloves. She talked for a minute and then started to walk out. Before she finished asking the questions, she had already said goodbye to us, walked out of the door and ignored us. Attitude Both cold and completely impatient. I made an appointment for an 11:30 appointment at the hospital's specialty department today. I've been waiting for half an hour, but it hasn't arrived yet. There are about 30 people waiting here. We had the same condition at Markham Hospital, and the emergency room time was about the same, but the doctor's attitude was much better, and the subsequent appointments for specialists didn't have to wait too long. I have been to the hospital in Burlington for different conditions. It is a little faster and the doctor's attitude is also very good. I have been to Oakville's emergency department several times and the nurses and other staff were all fine, but the doctor's attitude was very bad and it took the longest time. It was really the worst experience among several hospitals!"
