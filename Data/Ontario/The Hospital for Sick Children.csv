The Doctors are great but the real angels here are the nurses. Some of the most positive, warm and comforting nursing staff I have ever seen anywhere. They will literally go out of their way to ensure your kid does not have a miserable time here.
The hospital itself is absolutely beautiful and a lot of thought has gone into ensuring that it does not look nor feel depressing for parents, patients or visitors.

Special shout out to Lana and Jess, as well as Salma and Maria who were the amazing nursing staff at 7B65"

Anyway, it wasn't a bad experience. It's a clean and nice hospital with a lot of creative wall murals and pictures for kids. There are Shoppers Drog Mart, Starbucks, Timhortons, a Cafeteria, and some shops there that make it easy for you to buy food, coffee or any medicine. Doctors and nurses were kind and patient and did their best to make it a good day for my kids. They explained everything in detail for my son, but in a professional way, not to scare him or make him worried while distancing him and talking about school. They brought an IPad, some playdough, legos, and drawing sheets to entertain them. It's definitely better than other hosptials for kids. Thank you, SickKids team!"

Between 4am and 8am I guess it is safe to assume no doctor is working as they have not called in any patient whatsoever.
Free health care they say? At what cost? Is this fair? 8 hours and counting! #MyKidIsSick

Update: we saw the Dr at 8.30am. Left the hospital at 10am. That was a whopping 10 hour hospital visit.

Care: the care received from the Dr was very thorough and the follow up with the Clinical Social Worker is a real blessing.

Conclusion: Excellent care but wait time is horrible."

We did have a long wait in the emergency department but they treated us with such compassion and kindness. They made sure we had anything we needed and the nurses were even kind enough to watch my son so I could go to the washroom or get a snack.
Once we were moved to a room we were treated so well by the nurses and doctors. The doctors were all amazing and the nurses were SO great. They would always answer any questions we had and treated my son so well. I obviously wish we didn’t need to attend but the hospital staff made the experience so wonderful.
We had various nurses once we were admitted and all of them were so wonderful. The meal train is an amazing addition too. I could order my son any food he may have liked and we weren’t limited to one option. The nurses even gave him a little stuffy on the way out once we were discharged!"

The food menu was amazing lots and lots of options my son was taken care of through every way! They were starting a new program for parents / guardians called wellness bags and it was a brown paper bag given to me filled with some healthy snacks which I appreciated more then ever because at times I didn’t want to leave my sons side to go eat and this bag was a very nice surprise - it was filled with a croissant, fruits ( banana and orange ) tuna-crackers and a granola bar.

The Nurse practitioners and other medical staffs are also very caring and always help little children to be comfortable with diagnostic tests and other related processes. The overall hospital environment is also very welcoming. The nice and inexpensive foodcourt (has pretty much all common fast food franchisees) is a plus for parents spending long hours.
Only reason not to give 5 stars is general experiences with non-medical staffs (I could give 4.8 stars if allowed)... I find them pretty consistently rude with some exceptions."

My daughter has leukaemia and we have spent the last two months constantly frustrated with the staff here. No one seems to know what's going on, her chart is never updated, I'm constantly having to tell the nurses what medication she takes because they all say they will update her chart but never do. Plus the nurses expect the parents to give the patient their medication instead of them doing it themselves. The communication to the parents is extremely poor. One doctor tells you one thing then the next doctor doesn't seem to know where the last doctor got their information from. They expect 1 parent there at all times but don't have anywhere for parents to sleep. Parents are undermined all the time. Appointments are constantly changed with only a few hours notice with zero consideration of where you live, or hotel payments you already made and zero consideration for your family at home or child care plans. They let you know about discharge the day of leaving no time to plan for stay or rides.
I would never recommend this hospital to any child. For a hospital that is so "" top notch"" they should be ashamed of the state of this place. Too many changing staff for anyone to know the patient and they do absolutely nothing about it. Nor do they care too even though they say otherwise."

They do wonders at this hospital. Thank goodness for all the staffs especially the Drs and Nurses🙏❤️. Due to Covid only one parent is allowed for appointments.

I understand the need for one parent rule but when it comes to surgery it’s so hard to see only one parent struggling. No one for moral support from family and friends.

In this case I strongly believe hospital should have someone to talk to like a social worker on site to guide a worried parents or guardian. Especially when they take the child for surgery the parent or a guardian becomes so worried. I was able to witness them being helpless and emotional 😭. I was one of those parents 💔

Only complaint is about the underground parking lot, not easy to find parking spots also it’s not easy to take bigger vehicles like suv especially pickup trucks. If you can try to take smaller vehicle. Also if you go to SickKids often look into getting the parking passes at the main parking office located at the main parking entrance. I believe 5 day pass is $50 dollars but if you enter and buy the pass then they charge for 6 day pass for $60. Be safe.

They also have few restaurants and food court on the main floor by emergency exit. Shoppers Drug, Tim Hortons, second Cup and few gift shops as well.

We are extremely blessed and Thankful for SickKids ❤️🙏"

WORSE FOR KIDS

We've generally had positive experiences at The Hospital for Sick Children. However, yesterday, when we took our 3-year-old for blood work, the nurse was extremely rude. She struggled to locate a vein and kept poking multiple spots on my child's hand. After inserting the needle, she repeatedly moved it back and forth under the skin. The pain was unbearable for my child, who began to move, and then the nurse complained about it. It was a distressing experience, and my child is now traumatized."

The hospital has a little bit of colour and feels less sterile than most which makes it a more comforting place.
I used to go to the bunny wing (I think they’ve gotten rid of the animal markers since). I enjoyed my trips with mum, eating at the food court, shopping in their Main Street shop, and then visiting my favourite doctor. The staff was always friendly and they put us at ease. There’s a great health food shop here now too.

I was worried because the reviews weren't that good but it didn't matter because our options were limited and we needed help asap. We were so surprised to the level of comfort and support provided to us and our little guy while at the hospital. They gave him custom stickers, snacks, and a toy from the treasure box.  There was even a cartoon on the TV that made the hours go by easier. There was a Starbucks open until 1130 which was heaven sent for us.

But I wholeheartedly believe that other parents must be informed of the horrendous care my 7 year old, autisitic son was recently provided.

We attended the neurological department for a sedated EEG. This test was needed as my son has epilepsy.

Upon arrival it was very clear that the staff had no medical history or hadn't read my son's chart. The one nurse was on her phone and distracted while providing care to my son and the other nurse was very inexperienced and noticeably hesitant to interact with my son, having me administer the sedative for the test.

It was a very traumatic experience for my son and he was understandably very upset. We were told he was way too loud (crying) and after the test was complete, they all said how surprised they were it was successful because my son had a difficult time. The whole experience made us feel terrible. The staff were poorly trained and provided substandard care. No accommodation was provided for my son and this is unacceptable.  SickKids must do better."

I was referred to SickKids for bottle caries by my son's dental clinic as he needed general anesthesia for the procedure as he is under 2 years of age. The clinic staff was beyond amazing as it related to pre-op follow-ups and guidance HOWEVER, when I arrived the morning of his surgery, the operating doctors were less than pleasant. I was advised that I had to consent to the extraction of my child's teeth before I would receive a clear prognosis for why they chose to exact any teeth. So after declining consent to extract his teeth before understanding why the doctor said she'd need to send her supervisor over. Her supervisor came over and reiterated the same information as if I lacked the capacity to understand the first and after declining again and requested we do xrays so I could see the damages and set expectation she said "" you know what?  You can just cancel this appoint. You do not need to be here. Go find a private clinic."" It's beyond me that a parent can ask questions and receive a response filled with ego instead of empathy and compassion. Not to mention neither the doctor nor her ""supervising doctor"" even looked in his mouth to assess the situation. Grateful I did not leave my unconscious 1yr old in their hands. I instead found a clinic that took the necessary steps to assess the situation, share and discuss a treatment and made me feel 100% confident and comfortable. For a state of the art hospital, i'd give it a failing grade. Be sure to always advocate for your children."

One morning after we came there from CHEO(which we were at for the same reason I'm about to describe) an AVM in my arm caused a vein rupture while I was asleep, and so I had already bled quite a bit by the time I woke up. After we got the nurse a code blue(for life threatening medical emergencies) was called, and there were multiple staff in the room within seconds. Although it took a while and was very painful, they got an OR and fixed it up. Then had to be in intensive care and admitted to an upper floor, with astounding care from nurses, and constant surgeries to try and fix the situation in my arm. Also are following me and having us back every few months so they can do a full day of surgery each time to try and help my arm get a bit better. Also this was during my grade 12 year, and they have a program where teachers can come to your room and help get some work done on classes you'll be falling behind on. Amazing place with amazing people, and I wouldn't still be alive without them. Extra thanks to Dr Forrest and Dr Gasparetto, as they are the two that are most involved with the surgeries I'm getting(which are embolizations btw)"

We are so fortunate to have such a world-class hospital available in Toronto for children's medical needs.

What bothers me is the obviously inadequate funding that this important hospital gets from the Ontario government.  Why else would it be necessary to hold fundraising events in Costco and Walmart stores so that shoppers would donate money in those stores?

Also, I'm worried that the government is steering the health care system to becoming American-style where patients have to pay huge amounts of money every time they go to a hospital, any hospital in the States.  We need to protect our health care system to prevent monies being diverted to private clinics, with inadequate funding for our hospitals and medical staff working in those hospitals.  We all need to support our public health care system before it's too late."

When my child was sent there by his sick kids medical team, even though he was  immune compromised with orders to be isolated he was put into a hallway to finish his treatment. He got Covid from being in the hallway.
I don’t blame sick kids though.
He was put into the hallway because they were out of room and needed to save a child’s life who had a massive head injury from a car crash.
I blame every parent who drove past multiple hospitals with perfectly fine paediatric departments, to bring their child to Sickkids because their child had a bump or fever.
Sickkids ER is not really any different than St Mike’s, St Joe’s or North York general. Just to name a few. If your child needs the emergency expert care of Sickkids that can’t  be offered by your local hospital they will be transferred. If it needs to be done asap your child will be rushed by helicopter. Faster than any car. So do your self a favour, take your children to the most local hospital with a paediatric department. The wait times will be better. The doctors are just as good."

Felt like being cared for. Now it has become a joke of the former self. Took my niece there because she was sick with high fever for days. Waited 9 hours without seeing a doctor or taken any tests. The nurse there saw her few times after like 7 hours only to see her temperature and heart rate and would tell us to come back for another reading every hour and half hour without any short of progress on anything. Like it has become short of like a joke at that point. Figured they are not gonna do anything rather would keep us waiting without any treatment since we saw even some serious children in pain were waiting for hours and hours who were throwing up every hour or so. It was just gross and unsightly to witness. Few patients left without treatment even in a critical conditions. This kid with broken ankle left after hours of waiting without any treatment. This is nothing but complete carelessness by the staff and doctors. Sickkids has gone down to a disgusting level. We left without treatment after 9 hours of waiting to seek help elsewhere.  We felt unwelcoming with a wait screen that would read inconsiderable amounts of wait time and staff that are ill mannered and uncaring. Seeing other children in pain for hours without any treatments just a nightmare to witness. Dirty and unsanitary floors and chairs. I have no words to describe how horrendous this place has become.

However, after securing a bed, there was an additional four-hour wait to see the doctor. While I recognize the challenges, it was disheartening to wait for a medical consultation only to be informed that we were cleared to go home after the doctor's brief checkup.

In order to enhance the overall patient experience, I would like to suggest that the hospital consider increasing the number of doctors available, and if possible, encourage doctors to start their checkups a bit earlier. This adjustment could potentially help free up beds more promptly for patients in need of urgent care."

From the moment I entered their facility, I was met with ableism, prejudice, and a complete disregard for my right to bodily autonomy. Despite my clear wishes, Sick Kids, along with the consent of my parents, chose to subject me to a mutilating procedure that I did not consent to nor deserve. This procedure, driven by ableism and discrimination, has left me scarred for life, not just physically, but emotionally and mentally as well.

The decision to alter my body was made without my consent, stripping me of the most basic human right – the right to control my own body and identity. I am left feeling as though I inhabit a body that was chosen for me, not by me, a reality that has caused me immense pain and suffering.

Sick Kids Hospital's actions represent a failure not only of medical ethics but of basic human decency. No individual should be subjected to such a violation, especially within the confines of a medical institution that is meant to prioritize the well-being and autonomy of its patients.

I urge Sick Kids Hospital to reevaluate its practices and to recognize the harm it has caused to individuals like myself. I also implore others to be vigilant and critical of institutions that claim to prioritize patient care but fall short of upholding the fundamental rights and dignity of every individual.

In conclusion, my experience with Sick Kids Hospital has been nothing short of traumatic, and I hope that by sharing my story, others may be spared from similar injustices in the future.

Fortunately the  surgeons at Sick Kids were able to save my newborns life.
However, in my 30+ day stay at sick kids I learnt some things. The majority of patient rooms are empty. The majority of nurses are poorly educated. A lot of them are very young, either still in school or recent graduates. The hospital makes no distinction between, a nursing student, and an actual registered nurse. Students can be left to preform medical procedures completely unsupervised. In my case 2 students put the wrong NG tube into my child, and put it into the wrong position. This caused my child to have difficulties breathing. I had to argue with the staff for days, to get them to do an ultrasound to find out why my child was now struggling to breathe.
The nurses have a god like superiority complex and refuse to admit that they could be wrong about anything. Like putting the wrong NG tube into my child. When you bring up your concerns as a parent they say “ thats valid” and then completely ignore you. When challenged with questions, or common sense  they cower and stay silent.
The nurses have a one size fits all approach to healthcare. it is also evident that they do not read your child's chart before entering the room, or performing medical duties.
I can not stress this enough.  DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CHILD THERE ALONE OVER NIGHT. They are not watched, they are not supervised. Almost every night there was only 2 nurses to take care of an entire ward upwards of 32 children. Sometimes i would press the emergency alarm and have to wait 15-30 minutes for a nurse to show up. Sometimes they never showed up at all. A lot of the time there was just simply no nurses there. The nurses seem to be more interested in talking about there nails/hair/lunch then talking about how to care for the patients.
The hospital is not set up to have 2 parents stay with their child. In fact it is their policy that only 1 parent can stay overnight with a child.
When speaking to staff they will always make sure that there are more them then you. if my wife and i were in the room together, they would make sure that they would bring in 3-5 staff members in the day time to speak with us. This is a weird intimidation tactic, where you have 1 person that speaks and people who nod their heads along and try to discredit your concerns. They are often unable to admit that the things that the nurses do could have negative side effects. They are not able to tell the truth, or be open and honest about the health and safety of your child. They do not give you informed consent about what they are doing, and when something goes wrong they pretend it didn't.

The hospital will say that they do not have the medical supplies you need. There is a shortage we have to buy them from the USA, while spending millions of dollars on an administrative building across the street.  It is gross incompetence and negligence that these administrators will not advocate for the rights of children.
It is also offensive to MOTHERS AND FATHERS that the hospital is covered in transgender religious woke symbols. I did not see a single Pregnant man the whole time i was there. Yet those people have more rights than you.

In closing i would like to say that i am thankful for the surgeons for saving my child. But the rest of the care we received was more then subpar it was infuriating.  The DEI training of the government employees has put them in a position where they have a direct denial of reality. For instance they will not admit that a single person was fired from the illegal covid mrna gene therapy mandate. The surgeons and doctors, may be good, but the nurses the people you will spend the most time with. Are for the most part completely incompetent, and obviously just showing up for a pay check. There are however some diamonds in the rough, but they are few and far between."

Child is taken care 100% in all aspects.                              The biggest drawback is no one will be available on weekends. If anything happens on Friday evening then they will not progress anything on weekends and we need to wait till Monday even for major issues. Most of technicians will not be available on weekends. No decision should be taken on weekends. Better they can close the hospital on weekends instead of simply wasting everyone time. Management must look this and take proper step to work more on weekends. Simply wasting 2 days every week. I got surprised that unavailability of resources in hospital during weekends.

Attending doctor Dr Tony (Anthony) gave a thorough examination and along with Division Head, Dr Fischer’s subsequent assessment, a set of blood tests and X-ray were advised to carry out. Dr Tony was detailed in assessing my son’s condition as his Kawasaki’s could complicate the picture.

During our stay, the great team of nurses extended warm and loving care to my son. They were meticulous in every step of the treatment and they were courteous, friendly, and truly professional. To me, they are all Angels. In particular, I’d very much like to extend my deepest gratitude to the two nurses (didn’t get their names) who carefully and caringly performed IV injection for my son and in particular, Nurse Jen & Nurse Becca for everything they did.

With doctors’ diagnosis & proper treatment, coupled with nurses’ tender loving care, my son is now feeling much better.

Dr Fischer and his professional team of medical staff should deserve the highest acclaim and biggest applause!

Once again, THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH! Working in such hectic and stressful environment is really not easy and these professionals manage to keep up such positive vibes while delivering medical service of quality far beyond expectations!"

The hospital's environment was designed with children in mind, with colorful and engaging decorations throughout. It's clear that they prioritize creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere for young patients.

Additionally, the hospital offers a range of activities and play areas to keep kids entertained during their stay, which made a significant difference in my child's comfort and happiness.

I was also impressed by the hospital's commitment to family-centered care. They involved me in every decision regarding my child's treatment and provided resources and support to help me understand and cope with the situation.

Not to mention you’re not supposed to leave your room for the bathroom or food. Are they okay???  Anyone who thinks it’s acceptable to make a sick child wait this long for medical attention needs their head checked.
The nurses are rude and disrespectful. The hiring staff should be ashamed of the nurses they hire.
Sick kids is highly overrated. Best hospital care for kids?? Think again, it’s pathetic… especially when your child doesn’t even get seen by a doctor. I would and will NEVER recommend this hospital to anyone… such a shame since they “specialize” in paediatric care…
The entire hospital facility should be ashamed of themselves and the “medical services” they provide.  The fact that they could deem a CHILD patient as “not severe or not serious” is disgusting. This is a hospital for children!!! No child should have to wait 13-15+ hours to be seen by a “doctor”.

Im sure they are great for physical health issues but for mental health they are useless. Ive brought my 14 year old son to them twice now for blacked out explosions and each time they did nothing. The first time they called cas on me The second time i brought him in the Phsychiatry dr refused to see him.DO NOT BRING YOUR CHILD HER FOR MENTAL HEALTH HELP YOU WILL WASTE YOUR TIME

Instead of being treated my daughter who is 3 was drilled with questions after questions by the gyno who was extremely rough, and my husband was basically profiled as a someone who caused my daughter harm. This was a very traumatic experience for my family and I would NOT recommend anyone to this hospital plus the wait time is absolutely ridiculous 8 hour wait time just to be mistreated and left traumatized."

I had to stay for few nights with my little one  at the paediatric clinic and I can not thank my day and night nurses enough, Truly amazing.
Also Lyndsey the superstar of the neurology clinic is hands down the most knowledgable nurse I have ever seen. She is kind, efficient and extremely responsive.

We are sitting in the same room as people who are coughing constantly, and babies crying non-stop. No help, only painkillers. I could’ve done that with my daughter at home, give her 5 Tylenol pills and sleep cozily in a bed. Parents are stressing, just right now a guy who waited 11 hours to see a doctor left because he couldn’t wait any longer.

They'd always come to make sure I was comfortable and if I needed anything. No matter what, they kept smiles on their faces and were always the most generous and kind people. They respected my privacy and would knock and ask if they  can come in since I wear the hijab, despite me telling them they can come anytime, they treated me like an important person and I just loved them so much. I wish I could remember their names but there were different nurses everyday haha.
The only bad experience I had was the lady at the desk of the floor was really rude to me asking about my health care information and how I'd pay for my stay without it since I can't... Etc. Matters that was already discussed with the hospital and the correct people."

Turned out he had chaotic atrial tachycardia. Diagnosed by another cardiologist from a different hospital. Was told if the medication didn’t work go to sick kids. Son was in heart failure while we sat in emerg for 17 hours before he was admitted to the step down unit and stayed for 2 weeks. So my 7 weeks old baby in heart failure and had known condition and still waited 17 hours in emerg. Not a great place. Seemed very disorganized. Fast forward 10 years (my son was going every 6 months for check ups) doctor said he was cured… except he wasn’t and had to have an ablation surgery on his heart at 15. So glad to be rid of them and now with an adult cardiologist. Was not impressed for 18 years. For 18 years they kept showing ineptness time after time. Appointment after appointment for 18 years. Never spoke up because the staff wouldn’t have treated my son well. Should have got the patient advocate involved. But thought that would have made the treatment worse.

Both times, they appeared to have made up their mind before we even had a chance to share her medical history.  We were told to bring all of her medical information/reports etc. with us but didn't even bother to look at them even after I offered.  They contradicted other diagnoses made by other medical professionals and barely pay attention during physical exams.  When you ask questions or share other pieces of medical information, they are standoffish and condescending.  We have had a much better experience at Mac in Hamilton and will be asking to be referred there in the future.  My daughter's appointment today left her in tears from the frustration.  The building is also in very poor condition.  Like many other reviews, I question where the money is going."

5:01 doctor came and did the check.
I would say the doctor has pretty good attitude though.

For those who wants to visit here, these are the steps to expect.

1. Register.
2. Wait to be triaged in the lobby.
3. Triage.
4. Wait again in the lobby.
5. Assigned to a hub and wait again.
6. Doctor comes and examine your kid
6.1 if your kid needs x ray, iv, it will start now.
6.2 Doctor re-examine and decide what to do next or discharge you.
7. Wait the doctor discharge and go home.

Basically, you will have 4 waits, before triage, before assigned to a hub, waiting in the hub for the doctor to see you and wait the doctor to discharge you. Keep yourself hydrated and there is only 1 washroom to the public.

Work done and since then he's been in pain he had pulpotomy and the tooth is now infected cannot reach dental department. He's suffering all over again. Only so much tylenol you can give a child smh
Update here. Finally got an appointment for January because I got my dental office to send an urgent email due to the fact I was not getting my messages returned and front desk not answering phone calls. Now this is 3 months after he had the root canal treatment since he's been in pain. I bring him and they tell me it's not an infection so they did not diagnose as an access when it was clear the tooth was accessed. They told me let's follow up on the bump on a month. Fast forward few days ago bring him back now they say it's infected and the tooth had to come out. So after entrusting these dentists telling me root canal are successful in kids charged me for root canal and crown only to have it removed months later when it should have been removed from the begining. I was also charged again for the extraction. Very disappointed in the dental staff and team especially treating young children. Had to put my son through agony all over again."

Spoiled and entitled parents who feel that their child should have been seen faster because 'Johnny has a boo-boo'.  The Emergency department is for EMERGENCIES!  If you are not an emergency, you won't be going ahead of those who are more serious than your child.  Wake up!  If you want a 'first come, first served' experience, go to a walk-in clinic.  See your family doctor, talk to your pharmacist, talk to your mother even.  Stop clogging the emergency departments with non-emergencies.  Your the reason the wait times are as bad as they are.  As for rude staff, have you seen the rude parents?  Signs are everywhere because you ignorant folks think that if you threaten or revile a member of the staff, you're going to be seen faster.

The person who took her vitals was so beyond rude to me. I was scared because she is 15 months old, had the Covid vaccine and was suffering from 3 days of 105 fevers. They made me feel like a fool for coming in as I was told fevers can last 5 days and they won’t give me Tylenol since I have advil. Well from what I understand about vaccines is Tylenol is better since advil can have adverse effects on the vaccine. Why on earth would that not be considered. I left because there wasn’t a competent person there nor was anyone empathetic. Im a cancer survivor and sadly know the hospital system well and truly the triage staff and the admin staff is awful. I will never donate to this hospital and I will vote for anyone who says they fight for a two tiered system. I have never felt so low in my life thanks to the terrible staff there.

The second time I was there the reception made me wait an hour after my scheduled appointment and I had to GO UP and demand what was going on for them to REMEMBER to check me in and arrange for me to see the pediatrician.

So when we returned to the waiting room, she had left ( it was her lunch break).
We waited for the nurse to call us to let us know if the test was clear and be discharged. Instead, the Dr. herself, lunch bag in hand came looking for us. She said ""Oh good, you're here! Come back in and I'll see you now"".
The results were clear, and she gave us some recommendations on how to help my daughter get back on track and ease the discomfort she was feeling. The Dr. really impressed me with her kind and gentle approach and really kept my daughter calm.  We live almost an hour away, but was worth it, giving us piece of mind that nothing of an urgent matter was wrong.

Every time when I came here with my baby we had been waiting 9-12 hours!!! However when we were getting registered we were told that waiting time will me approximately 4-5 hours. We had urinary infection with blood in his urine with temperature and he felt severe pain through the waiting time. Who knows In what sequence they examine kids?? Why do poor kids have to wait so long enduring unbearable pain???

It can be very traumatic for young babies to have to be away for their homes and also separated from their parents. Yes, be ready to have to leave your wive or husband alone in the ER because the only allow one person. It's exaggerated and draconian. In the end a doctor came into the room and after a few minutes said that the bleeding with stop by itself and that there is nothing that can do. Go home.  The board should revise that specially for fully vaccinated people."

She would get assessed and we waited only 10-15 min to see a doctor. Because she had to be admitted and we got a room. That took a little longer. But the waiting room are still great themselves. All of the nurses and doctor we’ve seen here and interacted where amazing. Especially since my daughter is terrified of anyone with a medical mask on lol. Prior to coming to sick kids we would try to go to north York.  And that was the most terrible experience since they don’t specialize in kids. It isn’t much their priority. We’ve waited three hours without anyone coming to see us. Now if we are worried we drive all the way downtown from Thornhill to ensure she gets the best attentive care possible. Sick kids is truly an amazing institution.

Whiny parents who feel their child should be seen before others because they've had some minor complaint for a few days, or even a day.  They can use Google to spread negativity about SK, but not to find out what is considered a fever, and when it should be considered an emergency.  The SK website has valuable pointers that could save a parent a lot of time and stress.  The GTA has emergency departments all over the place, why you would travel hours to go to SK is beyond me.  If a parent thought it was truly an 'emergency'  they would access their NEAREST facility.  Alas, it's the whiniest parents who go to SK, clog up the system with their lack of common sense, itchy bums, coughs, rashes etc.  Bravo to the staff, especially the nurses, who endure complaining parents, rude parents, abusive parents, and all for a 1% pay hike."

Anyway, except for giving my baby some Tylenol for his fever (which I could do by myself), the doctors did NOTHING. Even giving a proper diagnosis.

Of course, when I ask if my son can be tested it’s a no because they would rather wait for the babies to stop breathing for that!
