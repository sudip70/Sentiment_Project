My family member came in at midnight did the usual checks and then required an ultrasound. Around 4am I asked what was happening with the test. It was only then that they informed me that there is NO ultrasound technician at night and we had to wait till 7am when they open. So if I had not asked I would not know this.

So at  7:45am we were still waiting in a VERY cold hallway, So I asked again and they said they don‚Äôt open till 8am and we wouldn‚Äôt see anybody till 9am.

I waited again and asked again at 9am and they FINALLY decided to call and said it‚Äôs another 30 mins!!!!  Keep in mind that they required a full bladder for this procedure and my family member was waiting since before 7am. How do they think it‚Äôs humanly possible to hold it this long???

Then next door to wear we were waiting is the X-ray office. People were coming from the fracture clinic and nobody knew where to go. They have  no clear distinct signs‚Ä¶ just a small sign on a cart. I had to direct everyone where to put their files and where to wait. How is this efficient!?!

While I did meet one exceptional nurse, the experience here was less than pleasant.

We are starting not to feel well because they made us wait in the coldest area ever! I hear even the workers complain about it  but nobody did anything to change it!

Still waiting‚Ä¶. (And it‚Äôs after 10:30am!!!!!!!!!!!)üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°

So much for coming for an emergency in an ambulance! We did not get emergency service!"

Apparently my father‚Äôs emergency contact was never updated. And what‚Äôs funny, the emergency department even asked for my name and phone number, assuming they'll call me for updates. I remembered changing his emergency contact the last time he was here few years ago and they haven‚Äôt change it until he was admitted.

My father was taken well care however, my father complained to me couple times there were staff members who were not nice when his food was given. My father stated, they were ‚Äúrude‚Äù.

I work seven days a week unable visit my father during the days and couldn‚Äôt be unable to speak with the doctors, I simply asked the nurses, the front desk to at least update me his conditions and I simply don‚Äôt understand why they could not call me as I am overwhelmed and frustrated by how the service went. I am unpleased by their customer service as it is quite poor.

The day of my father‚Äôs discharge, no doctors, no nurses and front desk did not bother calling me. And now, I am beginning to loose patience because no one did not call me/tell me what he is restricted of his diet and what he has to do to get better.

I HIGHLY recommend DO NOT bring yourself, family members nor loved ones because of my experiences here is horrible. I really do hope they get better."

So nice, so helpful, and efficient. The doctor saw me 30 min after the triage and then 30 min after test results were ready and I was discharged. Not sure who is running this place, but for the 5 hours I spent there, I think there is a huge problem with the ultrasound and scan departments. I was waiting someone to take me to the ultrasound room over 3 hours, almost 4 hours. Someone came to take me for ultrasound only after the nurse called them to ask as I was waiting over 4 hours. There were people waiting for scanners over 4 hours. This is unacceptable and inefficient. I couldn't understand were there any technicians at all in the morning or they just work inefficiently as when I arrived early in the morning, there were only 5 other patients and wasn't busy at all."

I believe there is a systemic issue to cause the extremely long wait time at the ED. Most of the doctors and nurses here did what they could. Expect being kept there for over 18 hrs, overnight. Even if your family physician called ahead of time and the hospital had confirmed that they had specialists on call, I just learned that ‚Äúon-call‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean he/she will come in the middle of the night. Very likely as a patient by the time when your results are back you are being kept in the ER for overnight as the specialists only come early in the morning. By the way, you don‚Äôt have a bed to lie down unless it‚Äôs a really really terrible situation- god forbid. Again, I think there is an issue in the Canadian healthcare system.

Some doctors and nurses here talk with an attitude, human flaws, we all have those in one way or another. However, what I‚Äôm trying to build up to is kudos to the triage nurse John - exceptional professional, calm, patient, attentive. You can see in his eyes that he truly puts the patients in front of himself. Also nurse Mei and Melanie. They deserve recognitions."

The amount I bled afterwards was insane, which never happened in all my life. It left a visible hole in my arm, enormous bruising, and a golf-ball sized lump.

Mainly because of the crowded environment, long waiting, and sensing a lack of empathy from doctors and nurses of emergency staff.

This mindset has completely changed after my one-week hospitalization.  On August 10th, 2024, suddenly, I lost consciousness and was taken by ambulance to emergency to Trillium Hospital. Eventually I was admitted to CCU where I was for five days. As soon as I am there, I started to feel a completely different caring environment.

I am writing this to express my wonderful experience from my 5 days in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) at Trillium Hospital. During my conscious and subconscious moment each doctor, nurses and other staff took care of me whole heartedly.  I am grateful for their sincere care, affectionate nursing and above and beyond attention. I am sincerely thanking you and grateful for the positive nursing experience."

The hospital does not provide anything at all. I asked for a breastmilk pump as my milk did not kick in and baby desperately needed it to the weight but they said they don‚Äôt provide pumps. The room was tinny and was shared by 2 families. The bathroom was so small and hard to use after a long delivery. My epidural was also done late so it did not work at all.

Let me tell you about the wonderful experience we had. The moment we arrived we were greeted by one of the volunteers who took us up to the second floor where we had to check in. He was very helpful and oh so pleasant.
Check in was done in seconds and wait time to be called in was only minutes.
Once my husband was assigned a bed to get ""ready "" for his surgery we were introduced to his nurse whom I'm sure her name was Leslie.  She was wonderful full of information and so kind especially with my husband being terrified of what was to come. She assured us everything would be fine and she would see us when he was finished.  We then met the surgeon, Dr. Lee who wad also very reassuring.  The nurse who started the IV was an absolute riot trying to calm my husband down and make the whole process fun even when it wasn't. After surgery I was informed immediately how everything went by Dr. Lee and was called by the day surgery unit when he woke up. Not long after he was discharged and wheeled out to me in the waiting car.

We cannot say enough how lovely and helpful the staff here was. I hope anyone needing some kind of surgery or hospital care can go here.  My local hospital could learn a lot from this facility

Thank you all

i left the hospital feeling a lot more suicidal and upset that they didn't care about my wellbeing. 2 days later, i went to CAMH's emergency department because i almost took my life. i was seen there much faster, the nurses were very attentive, and i was admitted the next day to one of their inpatient units.

Every single one of the staff was very good. My nurse even made me smile with her wit which eased my stress and really helped the situation. Then I went for a stress test in Cardiology and there was a little older lady there named Sophie.
She was in my mind unstable. She came at me with a razor and shaved half my chest telling me she needed to put the pads on so as to monitor my heart. Meanwhile I had pads on for the last 24 hours in 3 different areas. Then she started insisting that I wear a mask to get on the treadmill for the stress test. I felt this was not only unnecessary as no one in the whole place was wearing masks but also dangerous for a person with chest tightness and some shortness of breath already. Then she proceeded to speed the treadmill up at a very quick pace completing the hour long test in a matter of minutes. I had a heck of a time breathing after the incident. Some of the other staff even made faces at her and were telling her how to do her job so they obviously knew there was a problem with this person.
I still have upset thoughts and mild trauma over how I was treated by this woman.
When I filled out an out patient questionnaire and stated yes that I would like a phone call to discuss the matter I never heard back from anyone. I felt like she didn't like me because I was an elderly white man as that was all I could think of for her behavior. I wasn't rude, loud or verbally abusive in any way whatsoever.
In my opinion this person is dangerous and should have HR look into her behavior."

First of all, I will be forever indebted to Dr. Shahideh and Dr. Wilson for their expertise, experience and confidence to do what they do.
At pre-op I was looked after by a friendly and hard-working nurse named Jennifer who managed to juggle at least 6 other patients who were scheduled for surgery that morning with efficiency and a sense of humour.
I do not know the names of the nurses who assisted in the operating room but I would like to thank them for contributing to my successful surgery.
At post-op a wonderful nurse named HP was compassionate and very attentive to my needs.
I was transferred to the 1J Orthopaedic floor where I was initially taken care of by a nurse named Marian who was very caring, patient and knowledgeable.
Overnight, I was looked after by an amazing and compassionate nurse named Halyna. I had the good fortune to have her assigned to me for two nights. She was like a super hero who was always not far away and made sure I was comfortable. She  expertly found a vein in my wrist to re-insert my IV after I inadvertently removed it. She carried out her duties with a quiet confidence and good-natured attitude.
The next two days I was very fortunate to be looked after by two incredible nurses named Rose and Raman. Rose was so warm and caring with a beautiful sunny demeanor who always seemed to be smiling while caring out her responsibilities very efficiently. She was always very caring and patient. Raman was also very caring, calm and patient and made me feel like I was being looked after by a seasoned nurse with years of experience except she had not even fully graduated to RN status yet as she was days away from graduating. She will be a wonderful asset to this hospital for years to come.
Overnight, I was looked after by another wonderful and hard-working nurse named Carolina who was very professional and always not far away.  I felt I was always in good care under her watch.
Throughout my stay I was visited by a wonderful stream of nurses, doctors and physician assistants especially Mario Haroon who patiently answered and explained all my queries. They made sure I had everything I required and really put me at ease.
I would also like to thank the physical therapists who were very patient and knowledgeable and occupational therapist Kristen for her expert care, knowledge and positive demeanor.

For those of you who have read previous reviews on this site, you can see that my review and experience was much more positive than the others. I believe that this is because the hospital is making a concerted effort to improve overall conditions, staffing and patient care. They are on the right track!

This morning my heart rate ranged from 126 bpm going to highest to 150 bpm. I never had experienced that in my life and I could feel chest pain as if I‚Äôm having a pounding weight on top of my chest. Being a health care professional myself from William Osler Hospital, I expected to have immediate care as far as my nursing knowledge Chest pain must be attended right away since you don‚Äôt know what is causing the chest pain. Time is crucial and of big importance. I‚Äôve been having fertility treatment and I am taking Progesterone and Estrogen. The triage nurse in Trillium Hospital ER just checked my vital signs and told me to just wait to sit down and wait. I used deep breathing techniques to calm myself down, I‚Äôm constantly checking my heart rate, I had a Garmin watch, my heart rate is still in 120 plus. I have waited for an hour without anyone to check on me, I was not even given a registration patient ID bracelet, the triage nurse just simply ignored me as if i am nothing there even if my hand is on my chest and I am in a lot of pain from my chest. I approached the lady on the desk and told her I‚Äôm having tingling sensation on my fingers and legs and my chest felt heavier and heavier, as if I‚Äôm feeling out of breath. I told her I don‚Äôt want to pass out so I tried to inform them how I felt. There was a guy wearing a light blue shirt that approached me in a very insensitive manner, since I told them I am a nurse myself and I want to prevent myself from passing out before they will attend to me. The white guy wearing a blue shirt I am not sure if he is a nurse simply said to me in a sarcastic and unprofessional manner ‚ÄúSo you work in healthcare so you should understand how it is! Do you work also in Emerge?‚Äù This is so unprofessional and beyond my imagination how these people who is supposed to be caring and compassionate to any of their patients became so cold and so mean and I felt like they want me to have a code blue first before they will actually jump on their toes send simply attend on me. This is such a horrible hospital experience and I cannot simply believe that this was happening in this hospital who is supposed to manage cardiac care. I think that they wanted their patients to die first before they will do their duties!!! It is such a big disappointment because I am in health care field too and in my unit any patient that displayed alarming symptoms I attend right away. Prevention is better than cure!!! These ER staff in Triage is so horrible that I felt like they shouldn‚Äôt be working where they are because I felt bad for those who can‚Äôt speak for themselves. I understand it‚Äôs a lot of work for us health care professionals, it‚Äôs a lot of stress, too many patients and everyone burn out, but you don‚Äôt have to be so cold and so mean like you are just a robot and just don‚Äôt care anymore doing your job as a health care professional. My hard earned money paid the taxes for your hospital to function! Same with all the patients going to your hospital and especially Emerge! They paid for your salaries!!! So be nice and give your patients quality care and not crappy care like I received today!  For me to experience this today was unacceptable and such a disgrace to the kind of health care system we have in Mississauga! Please if you or your family member have chest pain please just go somewhere else aside from this hospital. If you treasure your life and your family members please go somewhere that will
Actually attend to your chest pain and treat your life more important than these horrible health care professionals who just simply took my Vital signs and asked me to sit and wait for a long time!!! It‚Äôs such a big shame!!"

I went into the ER at 3:00 am as there was an emergency.  However, the staff probably doesn't understand what an emergency is and made me wait for hours to be checked. I was in pain and could not hold it anymore, therefore had to leave without any medical assistance. The worst part was waiting in the ER listening to the loud laughter, chatter and mocking of the nurse's, who are actually supposed to be comforting were anything but that. It was my first visit to the ER which has left me in disappointment and fear for any such situation which might arise in the future, I know I can't look up to this medical centre at least."

ICU saved her life however moved to Cardo and a nurse stuck a contaminated IV needle in my wife. She developed sepsis as a result Kidney Failure and abscesses on her spine. That nurse just about killed my wife. Absolutely horrible follow-up. The blood disease specialist took 4 weeks to review her lumbar MRI and the Nurse Practioner withheld my wife's Discharge Report from her MD for 2.5 months.  She then went into kidney failure again due to the longevity of the PICC antibiotic input. Trillium never warned my wife about permanent damage due to the trauma on her spine. These people deserve to be fired and under criminal charges. Some of the nurses absolutely rude and unprofessional. If you want to maintain your sanity avoid Trillium Mississauga at all costs.

Due to my husbands vaccination status he was unable to come into the postpartum unit with me after delivering our first newborn (I am not vaccinated either). He got into an argument with one of the head nurses which was rude and told my husband ‚Äúhe should of got vaccinated‚Äù if he wanted to come into the room with me. After this little argument one nurse asked me if I felt safe at home- this really irked me as she should have understood our frustration. Funny enough they placed me in a shared room with a vaccinated couple‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt make sense I know.

They had ONE nurse for the whole birthing floor so they only checked on us once every four hours. (Mind you I just gave birth and alone) I called three times for a nurse within the hour and no one came due to only having one nurse. (Not my problem). Once the nurse came she was rude and fast and NOT helpful as I needed help breastfeeding. I could not believe the lack of staff and the support of the team in this unit.

Moving along to the interior of the hospital.  Old and dingy. I felt so disgusted. There were no showers in the postpartum unit and you could not open the washroom door all the way as the sink was stopping it.  Old, dirty and small. So so so disappointed in this hospital. The only good thing about my stay was I had my amazing OB deliver my baby. Other than that horrible experience.

I will say the nurses in the birthing unit were amazing !!!  (Minus that one little incident). Wish we could have done more but purchases donuts and coffees for the birthing floor"

I rather go to a hospital in a third world country than get treated like a peasant by these nurses.
Putting there hands in my face and telling me I don‚Äôt need to be here because I simple and kindly asked the nurse to clean her machine before hooking it up on me.
Another nurse started yelling at me about how it‚Äôs not her job to clean up???
Instead of these nurses complaining about a patient that CLEARLY needs to be seen by a doctor (I have been here for more than 24hrs)
They choose to ignore all my concerns and just bad mouth me the whole time.
I got told that my concerns are not worth being talked about - I had the security get called on me because I asked for another nurse.
I have never felt so disrespected and got treated like trash in my entire existence until this visit to this hospital.
A NURSE should NEVER raise her HAND or VOICE to a patient that is asking for HELP- I was not being rude or disrespectful, I simply asked them to help me with my concerns.
I have been asking them to see a manager for the past 12 hours and no one has come yet. They just keep throwing cards at me and telling me to call their complaint line- instead of dealing with the situation on the spot.
The nurse that raised her hand and voice to me also said she didn‚Äôt care about my concerns, my health, my wellbeing, told the other nurses they don‚Äôt have to worry about me, and that they should just keep me in a corner for as long as possible and she also told security that she doesn‚Äôt have to deal with me WHILE standing there and yelling at me when she could have just walked away.
I am too sick and too weak to even stand up for myself. I have OCD and really bad anxiety. The problem here is that you walk into a healthcare facility and NOTHING IS CLEAN. You ask someone kindly to clean their station or the machine they‚Äôre using and they refuse to do so- but are so quick to tell you to put a mask on (like that makes a difference)
I‚Äôve seen a nurse wear the same gloves on MULTIPLE PATIENTS!!!! that to me is just ridiculous and DISGUSTING. These nurses need to be RE TRAINED OR REMOVED.
Again, one of the WORST HOSPITALS TO EVER GO TO.
If you don‚Äôt mind waiting 12 hours and catching a disease before you even see a doctor this is the hospital for you.
Aside from the nurses, the DOCTORS were all very kind and willing to work with me and all my concerns. (PEOPLE THAT WENT TO REAL SCHOOL WITH MORALS AND VALUES- THE NURSES DONT HAVE) the doctors even took my side when addressing my concerns and even advised me to tell the nurses how I felt about what they were doing and how they were treating me. I have no problem talking to the doctors about my problems and conditions but the NURSES who think they are even qualified to say anything about how I feel or how I should feel is WRONG in EVERY WAY.
These nurses are NOT HUMAN and should NOT be allowed to treat patients like this.
I repetitively asked the nurses to stop being abusive towards me because of my anxiety and they continued to talk to me with disrespect. When I spoke to the security, he informed me that what I was saying was correct and I have every right to be upset with the way they are treating me .
I have so much more to say but I am having high blood pressure as I am writing this review.  This is the LAST TIME this hospital sees my face. I really hope these nurses get this message and fix up. Considering this hospital has 2.4 stars just says it all.
You will never see me in this hospital ever again."

The signs  everywhere said that waiting period is 1-3 hours.  mine was scheduled at 11:30 am and I was taken in at 3:24 pm Problem was that at least 10  patients who came after me around  1:30 -2:00 were taken in before me. The worst part was the rude nurse   F. D. who screamed  at me that it was different approach, and that's why I had to wait almost 5 hours. I asked her why my appointment wasn't scheduled at different time since it was supposingly different.  Every  other patient app lasted about 7-10 minitues and there was nothing special about mine, it was 7 minutes too BTW it was the same dr. and same prep time t Fter 4:00 hours I approached her  again to check why I have to wait so long and she shouted  about  special treatment (lie). When I started walking in front of the  nurse station back and  forth I was taken  in within  1 minute.Obviously there was some mistake but instead saying sorry , she lied and screemed trying to cover for mistake. To top it ,they even did't take off patches I had to do it myself.                                                                   P.S.  There are everywere signs saying that waiting period is 1-3 hours.while mine was more than 4 hours
Just for record:Nurses and doctors  had appointment time on  diagnostic imaging order request form and computer  screen to check and follow  appointment time.                                         Very dissapointed with stuff and their  customer approach and service."

First, I am amazed to see what the employees have to deal with in an emergency area. From serious cases, police activity, people not using the emergency services for cases that can be treated by a clinic, etc.

In spite of all that, the compassion all employees displayed to all patients was incredible.

My case was processed fairly promptly and the three  people in the triage area I engaged were professional and kind. When I was taken to the minor injuries area, the staff was attentive and caring.

I was brought in to a bed , the nurse quickly checked on me and minutes later the Dr. came to see me.

‚ÄúAs she said, not every day we see fish hooks in a finger here‚Äù, so she took her time to understand the situation, asked for a second Dr.‚Äôs opinion and they promptly addressed the issue.

All together the entire process took about two hours which considering all cases around me, seemed quite reasonable.

In short, I am beyond grateful to have this hospital and such caring professionals near our residence.

My sincere thanks to all of them in the emergency area. They are amazing professionals. We are blessed to have them."

My loved one was very ill suddenly and not one doctor called me. I later found out from his health records that I requested that he was in fact very ill with many different things but nobody communicated this with his family.
When I asked the charge nurse for updates she of course told me the doctor has to do that. Still, I received no call. My loved one died and I later had a conversation with the chief of staff about the so called doctors lack of communication with the family. He said he had spoken to the doctor concerned and he feels very bad and sorry that he couldn‚Äôt speak to you.
That is not a good enough excuse. The hospital has the worst care I have ever encountered. If you want to be neglected and die then please go here.

First of all most of the nurses can barely speak basic English.
Registration is a joke not to deal with what i have so for my allergies Etc, they put unknown what could happen to me.  They could not care less about any conditions that i have. Started to get over the shock of dogs. The kitchen did not bother to check if i am allergic. They gave me a dish with Curry so went into anaphylaxis shock. When i went up stairs to my room heard all the nurses laughing about my allergies and been allergic to bed sheets, Etc and i started to cry about that. The male nurse heard this and came in to comfort me to say it's ok as i was so upset and crying. This is why i gave 2 stars due to the male nurse who cared about me. The other nurses have no respect for others.
Also i brought some money with me and looks like some of the nurses help them self to some of the smaller bills that i had with me. This is called theft. And could have called the police.
This was the worst experience of my life. Asked the nurse for a towel so i can have a shower she refused to give me one so i used my shirt then put it over the chair to dry. Had to share the bathroom with another person. Knocked on his door to see if he wanted to use it. All of a sudden a large dark nurse comes in the room and starts yelling at me. This alone tells you what goes on. Turns out the nurses had been using my own test strips to check my blood sugar.  Am visually impaired and someone cut the string on my walking stick. Depend on that and the hospital is responsible. Thank goodness i packed my walking cane in my luggage for emergency.

I would recommend another hospital even if this is across the street, it‚Äôs literally 5 min drive for me but next time I‚Äôd drive an extra 30 mins to avoid this slaughter house"

They don't spend a lot of time talking to family, but they do spend their time taking good care of their patient.  I am from Burlington. Where everything is broken at our hospital.   Understaffed, overworked, really bad food, super expensive parking.  Old, broken, dirty equipment and rooms.  Compared to Joseph Brant Hospital, Trillium is a gem.  All the wheelchairs, beds and physio equipment are new.  The rooms are bright, cheerful and freshly painted.  And CLEAN.  The food is really good and the whole hospital has an air of competence, rather than harried desperation.    Parking rates are good!  Only 4 stars because they did not contact his family when he was admitted (95 yo)."

God bless the next nurse we had Andrea she was so nice and so gentle. After Andrea left, the next nurse we got spilled Fanta in our shared room that she got for the mother next to us and and Fanta spilled to our side and they only cleaned the other side of the room. And after sleeping post pregnancy the baby next to us wouldn‚Äôt stop crying so I mention to the nurse the baby is crying hysterically she told me it was because the baby was taking a bath come to find out the baby hasn‚Äôt had anything to drink for 24 hours because the mommy was trying to breastfeed with no milk coming out the nurse was unprofessional when I brought up the fact and told me ‚Äúdo you want me to kick them out‚Äù after I told her to check on the baby next to us. Overall I‚Äôm writing this to warning all expecting mothers & father to not have the same experience as my wife and I. Avoid this hospital at all cost. Shoutout Nurse Andrea she was a sweetheart and she shed a tear when my baby was born. Wish our stay would‚Äôve went nicer but All that matters is my baby was born healthy. Overall experience 1/10 and that one is because of Andrea

And Ps- if you are trying to get a private room this hospital has so many Covid restrictions you‚Äôll probably not get anything you ask for, even a bath if your pregnant wife is in pain- no gas for pain relief nurse told me she doesn‚Äôt know how to use it lol our health care system is a joke allot of nurse getting Covid degrees. honestly I felt like this hospital is more like a jail.

The labor process went throughout the night and into early morning, so mind you we were also lacking any sleep, but trying our best to learn things like changing diapers, breast feeding, bath etc. Below are some of the quotes from a nurse, during the post birth stay at this hospital, when we took a little longer or asked *any* questions.

""I have several other rooms to take care of, don't waste my time""
""I usually don't spend so much time with anyone""

The hospital should make sure new parents, especially first time parents, are given time to adjust and get appropriate rest before teaching them the various processes for a new born."

I would say within an hour of my arrival I was seen by a doctor who said they would order X-rays. I explained they had already been done. I was then taken to a treatment room where I was briefly knocked out, my arm set and casted.

More X-rays and I was on my way home I. Under 4 hours.

The next day at the fracture clinic the surgeon told me the emerg staff did a phenomenal job setting my wrist  nothing for him to do!

I was told to go sit in the car and wait. A few minutes later while I'm standing outside I see a couple walk up to the door. One individual sits in a wheelchair and the guy rolls her in.

After 2 hours wait in emergency the doctor came to check him and ordered xrays and just by looking at the arm he said he has nursemaid's elbow and twisted his arm very roughly twice by which my son screamed and sent him for xray. after seeing xray reports he said there is no fracture and thats he twisted the arm because it was dislocated and now its fine and sent us home.
the whole night my son was in alot of pain and his elbow got really swollen after coming back from hospital.
The next morning he started having fever and easnt moving arm again because it was swollen.
we took him back to trillium and this time it was another decent doctor who ordered xray again and just looked at arm and was genle with him.
xray reports show lots of fluid from swelling and he said there must be hair line fracture that we cnt detect right now and sent us to orthopedic in  credit valley to be seen next morning. so finally on 3rd day my son got to see orthopedic and he said there is a fracture and we put a cast on hom for 19 days.
my son suffered from pain,fever swelling and sleeplessness just because of the doctor who twisted his arm without knowing what was wrong.3 days were terrible for us.

He tried to appeal the injection with an outside lawyer as many staff started to dislike his decisions and motives in regards to my treatment.

He is a member of the lgtbq# community and he was partying quiet a bit for gay pride month and coming in late and even cancelled a meeting.

I was released after the Colorado Avalanche won the Stanley Cup. He lost his appeal. Also a nurse wasn't going to let me use the washroom and was going to have me deficate myself until I grabbed my note pad and was going to document the incident.

I think doctor Ali Kiganrula should lose his licence to practice, as even after release he ensured a clause that I could not drive in the province for 3 months after being released. likely bitter he lost the hearing and the appeal to keep me against my will.

I have been to this hospital 3 times in the last year. Once to remove a foreign object from my eye, once to seek assistance with an abnormal pain in my knee (from walking/bending), once as a birthing partner to my significant other.
The foreign object was removed from my eye in a timely manner, with politely staff & proper ""follow up"" instructions.
My knee pain was assessed, x-rayed, then examined. They told me I was beginning to feel arthritis pains. FORTUNATELY I followed up with a family doctor. They were totally wrong - I had fluid collecting in my knee.  The family doctor removed the fluid & gave me a cortisone shot, stating that he would NOT send me back to the hospital because of the horrible initial assessment. (it should have been noticed immediately because of the bulge in my knee & unusual warm temperature of the joint).
As a birthing partner I noticed that the ""suites"" were comfortable, but not all staff were focused on the individual patient. Some treated the birth as a ""get it over & move on to the next"" situation. The recovery rooms (regular & semi-private) are only set up to comfort the baby and mother.  It was very difficult to remain comfortable & be there to support my significant other and help to care for the new born.

The one star instances are due to cuts in provincial government funding where lack of beds or rooms are available!

If your condition is critical, you will be prioritized. That‚Äôs fair to me. It also helped that I was upfront and fully disclosed my condition which helped speed up the process.

While I had to wait, nurses provided instructions and details on what will be done to have an accurate diagnosis. They also provided status updates and told me how long the wait times would take for each procedure and the next steps. They don‚Äôt mind if you follow-up if you sense it‚Äôs taking long. The nurses and attendants where patient, respectful and kind.

Yes, there was ‚Äúhallway medicine‚Äù but I saw the doctors treat and talk to the patients with care. They‚Äôre doing the best they can with what they have. I understand. I also noticed an ER doctor calling to follow up on his patients to ensure they‚Äôre ok, taking the prescribed meds and asking for their well-being. I was lucky enough to have this same doctor (Dr. P. Channan) attend to me. He read the results, my medical history, and asked me again. Very through. He also spotted the problem (which the other doctors didn‚Äôt) and provided a reassuring prognosis. He also prescribed the right meds, gave a printout of my condition and explained how to take care of my health. He even discussed recovery period and aftercare. I was impressed with his skill, sincerity and calmness.

I was out of the ER in a matter of hours. Considering the condition I was in before I was admitted, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre good and I‚Äôm happy to see the improvements. Thanks again, Dr. Channan."

Unfortunately they are grotesquely understaffed, which means patients are left waiting for hours before they get assessed. And I do mean HOURS.

I walked in here a little after 4:30 pm and it looks like I should have banked on an overnight stay, as I'm still waiting to be x-rayed at 12:45 am. However,  this is not the fault of hospital staff, it's because of patient volumes, which are horrifying.  The staff at the hospital are stretched too thin, but they treated me like gold, regardless.

Thanks for getting me through this! Now back to waiting for the x-ray."

Nurses just sitting around talking about their personal lives ignoring you when you ask a question. I recieved a needle and was left bleeding out all over the bed and floor for 5 mins, after BEGGING nurse #3 for help because the first 2 ignored and cut their eye at me, she THREW gauze at me and told me to clean it up. Meanwhile a senior citizen died while waiting in the hallway and her daughter was calling for help and no one would help her.  Please i urge you, if you can help it DO NOT visit this hospital unless you do not value your life. Patients are definitely not a priority here."

But the mental health centre, HOLY they are so unprofessional and constantly mess up people‚Äôs appointments. Every time I was in the waiting room there was someone else who apparently was too early or too late for their appointment. The receptionist just messes up all the bookings.
I wish they were better as there are people who really could use help.
I called to book my next appointment and apparently I was discharged without anyone telling me? Yet the psych is still filling my prescriptions how does that make sense.
The psych is ok to talk to but you‚Äôre always rushed out ASAP and half the time she‚Äôs talking to the receptionist over the phone about who‚Äôs next.
Mental health issues, go to sunnybrook,  never go here."

There was something stuck in my throat for 5 hours. I came to the hospital as soon as possible. I only met the doctor for 3 minutes and she sent me for a CT scan. The CT nurse was in full swing with my family. Call up? ! ! is this normal? I sat outside and waited for him to finish calling before I could go in. Then there was endless waiting. My throat became more and more sore and my head hurt more and more. I had to work early the next morning...

I am from Colombia and I am visiting and helping a daughter for the birth of her first daughter.  I had to go to the emergency room for health reasons.  They attended to me quickly and the service was timely and effective.  Very attentive and friendly staff despite my difficulty with the language. The nurse who took my blood tests and EKG supremely diligent and careful.
Thank you very much to everyone and to the triajje people.  ANGELA RUTH CARRASQUILLA MONTOYA."

This hospital is so bad, I wonder if there is only one doctor in the whole hospital. I was a pregnant woman and went to the hospital for emergency treatment due to bleeding. I arrived at the hospital from 4pm in the evening and had to queue up and complete the procedures before entering the patient waiting area. Unexpectedly, I had to wait for 6 hours and I was not called until 10pm. It made me so angry... There were so many new patients coming in one after another that the whole waiting area could no longer sit. Several patients had to wait for more than 5 hours. Some people couldn't wait any longer and just gave up... I I really want to talk about a bullshit hospital, are there any that treat patients like this? By the time you see the patient, he will be dead. What‚Äôs even more ridiculous is that at 10 o‚Äôclock in the evening it was finally my turn, but I had to wait in the ward for another half an hour. Oh my god, is the doctor dead? He kept making people wait. Then a female doctor came and gave me the answer. I took a blood pressure test and said it was normal. The blood test report was normal, so I was told to go home... I was immediately angry. You told us to wait for 6 hours just to take my blood pressure and then tell me to go back. You wouldn't have told me earlier. Come on, I really deserve to be scolded for taking so long... I swear I will never go to this place again. After waiting all night, all the patients were complaining. They should really complain about it..."
