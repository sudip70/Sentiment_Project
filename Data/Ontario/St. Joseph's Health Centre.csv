Parking is incredibly difficult. If you enter the parking lot just off Emergency there is no signage to indicate you need to turn left to get into underground parking. I am one of many who turned a very awkward right and ended up exiting. If you use the parking garage on the east side, it can be hard to find the elevator to the bridge to access the hospital. When you find the elevator it can be confusing to figure out which button to use to access the bridge to hospital. Navigation to various departments is sketchy at best. Bathrooms located near Emergency are sketchy. The one I used did not lock easily. Try calling the main phone number and wait endlessly to get through the recorded message. Wait again until you get a live person who finally puts you through to department that does not answer.  Picked up my husband 9 days ago and someone was illegally parked in the spots designated for picking up patients. No one around to help or ticket the selfish idiot illegally parked, I will avoid this hospital as much as I can other than the excellent medical staff, thoughtful dietitians who prepare real food and very helpful staff."

I spent a lot of time throughout our pregnancy this year at the birthing centre, well cared for. Each nurse I had the pleasure of meeting did more than take care of my physical well being, but also helped put me at ease and made me feel so supported. We spent 7 weeks in the NICU this year and were blown away by the amazing care our baby received. The nurses, doctors, and staff were so encouraging and passionate about their work. We always felt safe leaving our little one in their hands. Each nurse with their own special way of caring, but also working so well as a team. As he grows, we are more and more grateful."

However, the nursing staffs apathy and lack of response I need to give this hospital the lowest rating possible.  I went in knowing what had happened. It was a ""moved rib"" or a ""dislocated rib"" or a ""rib flare,"" relatively all the same thing.  The ribs themselves are not broken, but they feel exactly like broken ribs.  I am having extreme pain, difficulty moving, breathing, and talking.  All of which could have been resolved with appropriate medication.  I was there for hours waiting. I was nearly about to collapse from the pain because I was unable to sit.  I hoped I would pass out if I fell.  The doctor saw me and was surprised I hadn't received medication and tried to hurry them up.  Still waiting, I had turned myself face-first to the wall, I was propping myself up against and was hitting my head against it.  Desperate to make the pain in my ribs less.  Eventually, the nurse did show up with the medication while I was doing this self-harming act.  She did not take note of it, but unstead got upset that I wasn't responding to her.  Every breath was painful, and speaking was far worse.  Later, I had to make my way to x-ray, and I desperately needed aid.  I had a bag with me and I couldn't carry it; let alone reach it on the floor.  I called for help at least a dozen times to any hospital staff that walked by... but nothing.  None of them could take the time.  I ended up kicking my bag along with me to x-rays.  When I passed by the front check-in, the staff helped me.  I was very thankful for that.  During the x-ray, the technician pushes me to get into the frame, I am unable to scream, and I am in some of the worst pain in my life and the push me.  They denied pushing me, I didn't have the strength to say otherwise.  Leaving x-ray, I am again kicking my bag down the hallway because they don't care.  I saw my doctor 3 times while only seeing a nurse once.  This seems strange to me.  I found the nursing staff to be desensitized, uncaring, and unnecessarily prolonged the pain I was in.   What made this experience horrific was because I was utterly helpless. Taking a breath was agony. Calling for help was useless.  I hoped that someone would see I'm not acting right, I was standing for hours while being in some of the worst pain in my life, ""Please notice I need help,"" yet nothing."

I couldn't believe that a hospital wouldn't take measures to ensure that every body can have x-rays safely. Then the doctor wouldn't even consult with me as to why I was even there. I have no broken bones, just arthritis and pain. It's the most dehumanizing experience. I couldn't even hear what was being said to me. I don't want to return to this hospital ever again,  even after the construction is over. It's clear to me that I'm just a number to you and not a human being with real problems.

I would say mine was quite good given the fact it’s an emergency unit and everyone wants to be seen asap. They were very accommodating to my immediate needs and the triage/registry personnel were incredibly kind to me. Waited about 15 min before I could see the triage lady, 5 min until I registered and saw a doctor within about 30 min upon arriving at emergency. Had bloodwork , urine and ultrasound all finished up within 1.5 - 2hrs and total stay there was about 4hrs .. not bad considering the amount of ppl that were in the waiting room .. mind you this was a Saturday morning around 9:30am so not sure if that makes a difference but IMO there were a substantial amount of patients.. I can’t remember the doctors name but he was attentive, respectful and honoured all my requests. As I began mentioning above had my test results and was on my way home in a approx 4 hrs. By far the best experience I’ve had in a hospital (if there is such thing) and much more thorough than going to a walk-in where they make you come back for multiple appointments or tests, and here you don’t pay $70-$90 for bloodwork. It’s a very practical one stop shop and you just need a little patience to get through it all.

A few years ago I went to Trillium in Mississauga and have to say they were rude, non responsive and treated me like a dog left outside during a winter storm. Would never go back there and wouldn’t recommend their emergency to anyone.. but again I guess every person experiences these situations differently depending on the day, the staff and their own attitude towards the personnel. However mine at St Joseph’s was as good as one could expect for it being an emergency unit. Hopefully never have to go back to emergency but if I do it will be at St Joe’s"

If you're about to give birth in there, this review is for you. I wish there was a separate google page for the birthing centre because it's completely different from the hospital.

I just had my first baby there and quality of care my baby and I received is exceptional. All nurses throughout our stay (3 days) were extremely KIND and supportive. They were very attentive to every single request and very proactive in providing care and checking on us.

The team of doctors and nurses who attended labor are just the BEST I have seen from healthcare in this country! They were supporting me while I was in pain, explained every single step and offered to have me play my own playlist to help distract me.

Another team of pediatricians were also there to check the baby and make sure all is well. Nurses were reminding hubby to take photos and videos. Our favorite nurse throughout the whole stay is Michel (you're lucky if she's ur nurse)!!

Had an exceptionally positive experience. I hope every mama gets the same love and care!!"

He has been in pain for about a month now and we have made 3 total ER visits because of the intensity of the pain. The only doctor who took him seriously was Dr. Colin Rafferty who we saw the second time. Otherwise, he was sent home with pain medication that did not work and other very temporary solutions like “stretching.” We were referred to the urologist Dr Jain who was awful for reasons I’ve written in a separate review on him. All in all, we are feeling very helpless. The wait time for ER is relatively quick compared to other hospitals I’ve been to. That is about it. Depending on your needs, I suggest going elsewhere to be taken seriously and to receive medical care that goes beyond simply diagnosing, but also provides preventative measures and not just short-term solutions (and referrals to other doctors that do not care)."

The triage nurse was thorough and caring, quickly passing me through to the registration nurse and then to the yellow zone.

Although initially daunting to see over 40 people waiting, my pain was severe, and I was seen by Dr. A Sue-A-Quan after just 20 minutes of waiting. Dr. Sue-A-Quan radiated positivity, promptly diagnosed my condition, and answered all my questions with patience. He ordered blood, urine, and an ultrasound to confirm his initial assessment and provided pain medication to alleviate my discomfort.

The nurses who took my blood and administered pain injections were both kind and knowledgeable, ensuring I was comfortable by providing a room to lie down and an extra blanket. Despite the whole visit taking around 6 hours, most of this time was spent waiting for lab results. By the end of my visit, I walked away with a diagnosis, pain medication, and a form to visit urology for a follow-up examination.

This is what we ideally expect from RNs and they delivered. A clean environment both outside the room and inside.
However, with every institution there are some individuals who has special powers to disappoint. One such was Nurse Michelle Ash. She is knowledgeble but absolutely no compassion. This nurse promised she will do a lot of things relating to assistance on post delivery but ended up doing just 10%. With lot of bleeding, the nurses prior to her shift used to proactively  provide more change of clothes including disposable wear. This one was reluctant even though the bleeding didn't  stop and requesting multiple times.

I would have given a 4 to 5 star review for the lady psychiatrist who attended to me with so much sympathy and compassion but I must say the emergency dr T K who made me give a 2 star rating. I have never seen such aggressive and impatient doctor towards a patient who was struggling with mental health. There was not one ounce of sympathy coming out of his mouth or towards his body language other than making me feel more intimidated and fearful to talk. If I was in the right mind of frame, why would I come to the emergency in the first place? Does this doctor think I came for a picnic and wasting his time where he can treat “real” patients? He was very patronizing and made me feel even worse than ever. He didn’t have the decency to pass the paper in my hands and just dropped it off on the bed not explaining what the paper was about and left. I was left in tears more so than ever towards his demeaning behaviour. I saw that he’s received many distinctions and praises for his professionalism. Wow, it’s hard to believe that I didn’t receive the same sentiment towards this elite doctor. I understand how stressful and exhausting doctors are but when I went to Toronto General two weeks ago for the same reason, the emergency doctor was completely the opposite of him assuring me and sympathizing with my symptoms. I am sure Dr T.K. is an excellent doctor in his own right but I hope he understands that treating patients equally and with no judgement and compassion should be a criteria he needs to be reminded of besides showing off his skills to treat “noticeable” illnesses."

She was taken to hospital via Ambulance for a very painful kidney stone. She was triaged quickly and attended to prominently. She is a bit hard of hearing but they were patient when explaining and asking questions. When drawing blood, the nurse was gentle and able to get blood on the first try. She also commented that if she wasn’t able to find a vein (tough in older folk sometimes), she would have another try instead of repeatedly poking her, as I have seen others do which leaves any elderly person's skin bruised. Other examinations were performed with explanations and answers to any questions.

I am in hospitals frequently due to my profession and many times I see patients rushed through. I also understand the demands on medical professionals in hospital settings can be overwhelming. However, the emerg staff at St. Joe’s treated my Nonna with humanity, kindness, and dignity.

The most caring and professional emergency staff.  Everyone was way beyond my expectations.  I felt really cared for and treated with dignity.  From the doctor who saw me and the nurses who took care of me right down to the porter who took me for imaging.  Everyone was so great.  On your worst day it's good to know they have your back.  Thank you St. Josephs staff!

My son (2years old) went in yesterday with some neck pain and I was told there would be some X-rays taken. We waited almost 4 hours and no X-rays were taken, they barley felt around his neck, they sent me home with absolutely nothing. He’s in more pain than yesterday. Doctors and nurses were playing around with each other and pushing each other around more than anything."

Dr. Lehnert and Dr. Sadler. They are both so caring, professional, knowledgable and pleasant.
They have exceeded our expectations for exceptional medical care and arranging tests and procedures to ensure my brother’s health is restored.
I met Dr. Lehnert over 20 years and ago when he took care of my mother after her stroke and then again in the emergency department. His expertise and superb  care added years to my mother’s life!
What a miracle to connect with him again now during my brother’s medical issues.
In addition, we are so grateful to Tanya and the 2E medical team, Sarah, the operating nurse and Dr. Ma.
We will be making a donation now to St. Joseph’s hospital as a gesture of appreciation. And we will also include a donation in our will in memory and gratitude of a beloved family member.
With immense gratitude and respect,

As I was struggling to pay my parking at the meter, I realized that I was getting late for my appointment. The lady standing by me had earlier withdrew in my favor and was waiting for me to complete my transaction. I took my chances and went to my appointment without paying for parking. When I returned, I saw a note and a paid parking receipt at my windscreen, under the wiper. The note said that she had mistakenly paid my parking because I didn't cancelled my transaction earlier! I was embarrassed and awe struck at the same time. Honestly, I wasn't moved by her act of paying but by the language of the letter, which was so caring and considerate! If she ever came across this post, I just want to thank her and let her know how embarrassed--and thankful I am. Our world goes on because of people like her! Kudos to her!!"

2nd Visit - Follow-up scheduled echo cardiogram, Holter monitor. Removal of stitches. Once again very efficient for the scheduled appointments. Some waiting to be expected in emerge for the the follow-up on the wound. I observed very kind treatment of patients.

3rd Visit - Appointment with cardiologist Dr. Lukasz Drzymala. Just a fabulous physician. I felt very confident in his insight on my results and the fact that he looking very closely at my medical history and family history, making notes etc. I really felt heard and not rushed. Very impressed.

Our experience there was FIVE stars. My mom had a fall and she was checked from all angles with CT scan and X-rays. She had a 17cm skin laceration on her leg and it was beautifully looked after. However ..., we received a referral form for plastic surgery follow up in 7 days. It states clearly on the paper to call after 10 am on the next business day to book the follow up. And this is where it all went wrong at the ambulatory clinic. I was eager to get the follow up booked and I called first thing Monday morning at 8am, August 24, 2020. I was told they did not receive the referral and to call back after 11am. I called during my lunch hour after 12pm and was told they did not receive the referral. As I wanted to have the appointment booked ASAP I offered to fax or email the referral I had in my hands. They said and I quote - it does not work that way. I asked for a nurse in charge, I was told her name is Val and she would not speak to me , but they will look for the referral and Val will call me back with appointment before the end of the day. By 3:30 pm nobody called, so I called again and I was told AGAIN that they have not received the referral yet and to call back tomorrow after 11am. On Tuesday, Aug. 25 I called my mom’s GP and asked her to call the Ambulatory Clinic. She called me before lunch and told me that when she called they did not have the referral but the secretary will personally look for it and give it to the charge nurse to triage it. Since nobody was calling me, I called AGAIN the ambulatory clinic on Tuesday afternoon and after the secretary put me on hold, guess what she told me - THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE THE REFERRAL FROM THEIR OWN EMERG DEPT YET!!!!!!! Five times in two days they could not locate the referral. How is it possible these days?  I actually lost my patience at that point. I was put on a long hold and finally the referral was located. My mom got an appointment for Sept. 4, 2020 which is 14 days after her fall and the stitches, despite clear indication from the ER doctor to have the wound looked at in 7 days. Hope to never had to go or my family to St Joes for any reason ever again. So help me god."

I had a condition that no doctors took seriously for about a year. I finally had enough and after some advice from a third clinic, went to the ER at St. Jo's. A doctor with med student and nurse saw me in about an hour and treated the problem with excellent bedside manner. It felt such a relief to have everyone, including, apparently, the triage nurse who put me in the queue, validate me and the seriousness of my condition, and treat it immediately. The problem shouldn't come back. I'm so grateful for their care and at least based on this experience I would recommend going to St. Jo's. Thank you!"

I still have no number and I’m waiting an hour and a half and have not been checked in yet. The woman who was working the ticket counter decided to write down which number everybody was but didn’t know what number her ticket machine left off at so all the numbers she gave were already numbers people had and it’s  mass confusion in this emergency room. For the entire first hour that I was waiting no one cleaned the seat between patients checking in and all of a sudden a woman just started now doing it so I’m not sure if she was not in yet or what happened but I think I might have to take a cab to Mount Sinai.

ER doctor ordered CT scan without contrast to spare my kidneys. That was his choice. Next day I arrive and the very young person working in CT prep forced me into contrast by excessive pressure and disrespect, told me that my kidney function wasn’t that bad, kidney failure is worse. I told her to never tell a patient what they have isn’t that bad because you don’t have to live their life with the condition. I told her poor kidney function means you have to give up many things you love and she sneered at me like I meant alcohol when I rarely drink and meant my horseback riding and other sports. I left after the CT scan with no diagnosis and possibly worse kidney function and a deep hatred of the young people with limited emotional intelligence working at the hospital. When I worked for the Ministry of Health, in a patient/client facing role, I never would have spoken to anyone that way. You can’t tell someone that what they have isn’t that bad when you aren’t the one living with the condition and those of us concerned for our kidneys never want them to get worse but live in fear that medical intervention will do more harm than good. Do better. ETA: ER doc missed that abdo pain and lump were caused by dislocated ribs. Waited another 5 months of pain for tentative diagnosis and that’s a total of 9 months since my first visit after a fall from a horse that caused the injury. Don’t recommend this ER even if the wait times are great."

All of the nurses and doctors were amazing!!! Specialists were called in to find the cause of his mystery illness and they left no stone unturned. Many tests were done and he received high level care. I cannot say enough about this hospital. Every time we've needed them, they went above and beyond to ensure we received exceptional care. I'm so grateful to the stellar staff that work tirelessly around the clock where they receive very little praise or encouragement. God bless them! We are grateful this hospital is part of our community. It's peace of mind for us!

After a wait of 5 hours the Doctor asks you to take OTC drugs for a high grade flu. The Doctor says blood and urine tests will help the diagnosis but discourages you from taking them by saying it will take atleast 2 more hours for the tests. This all is happening between wee hours of 11 pm to 5 am. So many children and adults were crying with pain waiting for the Doctor. The hospital had only one Doctor for the night emergency.  Governmet should intervene and take action against them for treating the patient s with put any care and compassion. Please help the patients they are already in pain, do not Subject them to further pain."

It smells really, really bad, dirty and disgusting! Doctors and nurses here are not professional at all, they’re very rude, and cold hearted and they don’t care about any of the patients at this hospital. They only care for themselves and what their plans are for the day/evening and or weekends with their family and friends and/ or boyfriends and or girlfriends- Disgusting! My point is - NO ONE CARES!! It’s really sad and hurtful to see your loved ones in so much pain and begging for help and care while doctors and nurses are acting this way? Really unacceptable behaviour! How is this even allowed??? -they should be doing their job as what they were taught in medical school and acknowledging all patients and providing the best care for them.
Also, I’ve seen doctors and nurses always chatting among other staff and on their phone, texting and FaceTiming.
Worst part is that - they’re ignore , laughing and giggling at patients who are in severe pain and don’t attend to them when they need the care. I’ve seen patients died and have died at this hospital in the past due to the lack of care and professionalism in this place… very, very sad. What kind of health care is this?
So, moving forward my experience here a while ago. I had brought in my Grandpa. And he was in severe pain. He couldn’t breathe very well. Doctors and nurses had no clue what was wrong with him. It took them days to figure it out -so,  finally they did something good - they had him do many tests.
They said everything was normal and he was in good shape.
Besides that he was just ‘an elderly at very old age and said they couldn’t do anything for him. So they sent him home!!
Really?? Unbelievable! I was so upset, in fact very stressful and sad to see my grandpa suffering.

Then, I took him to another hospital turns out he had a tumour in his left leg🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️. They were able to remove it in time and is now recovering from surgery. He will be okay due to the great staff and care at that hospital.

I have many friends and family that go to this hospital because it’s so close to home and they have no choice to go anywhere else. It still makes me sick to know and hear disgusting events happening and that there hasn’t been any improvement in the health care system among doctors and nurses.
😣 ugh,
I could say so much about this hospital that it sickens me.

The care I received was horrible, not just for myself, but it seemed for everyone there.  I arrived at 11am to triage and was not physically seen by a doctor or a nurse until 3:30pm. I got an IV and it ran out, so blood started to back track down the IV tube, I let a nurse know, and it wasn’t until 2 hours later that they tended to it. By that point the blood was dry in the IV tubes and they had to completely switch the tubes. At that point, I asked to leave, as the care I was receiving at that time was not good and I would have rather been at home in pain in my bed, then continuing to be forgotten about. This then led to a panic attack in the ER, the doctor agreed to give me one more dose of medicine and to then discharge me. I was discharged at 7:45pm. I then received TWO phone calls from St Joe’s ER one at 8:45pm and the second at 12:47am asking if I was “still in the hospital”. Even though, I was DISCHARGED at 7:45pm. The ER was very disorganized, lack of care, empathy, and barely any treatment done. Very disappointed."

For example, when my father’s dentures were falling out of his mouth she said “ EW IM NOT TOUCHING THOSE” and was also claiming to be “scared to touch” my dad who was already being restrained in his bed. If this is how she treats patients who are in desperate need of help, than she SHOULDN'T be working in a hospital setting. This was an extremely terrible experience, not to mention that my father was released (able to leave alone) just a few hours later when still clearly showing signs of intoxication. The staff member who made those comments was a white girl, in her early 20s , about 5’7 with puffy curly hair wearing a red sweater, crocs and kaki capris. If she wants to continue making unprofessional comments, please don’t do it in front of a patient and their family."

Additionally, I have to thank Dr Rebecca Zur (high risk doctor) for my most recent visit. They performed a cerclage due to my IC and was super open, honest and compassionate.  They also connected me to Mount Sinai for further care which I was so grateful for.

I went in with horrible chest pain and unable to breathe. After 8 hours, and a multitude of tests the original ER Dr who saw me apparently went off duty without telling anyone. I was told they forgot about me. I ended up seeing  a new Dr who told me I had pneumonia. I was sent home with 5 pills of antibiotics that I was told would cure me as this was ""not a serious case of pneumonia"". The next day when i woke up I was in massive pain, unable to breathe and was scared for my life. I could not swallow the antibiotics and kept puking them up. I went back to the ER and out of blind luck the same Er Dr who sent me home saw me waiting in triage after coming in from a coffee break. I was right away admitted.( blind luck i think) Turned out they read my xray wrong.. I had massive fluid in my lung and my Sp02 (oxygen levels) was under 70% (normal is 90+)I spent 4 days in random Er beds, where I ended up having a chest tube put in as the pneumonia was that advanced. What I saw in the ER during that time made me sick. The way nurses gave 0 f'ss about people and  also me was something out of a nightmare. People were crying out for help, in pain or soiled themselves, or begging for help or having a mental health crisis and none would come to them to help, nurses would never be available after 12 Am I was told.  After four days they tried to put me into a COVID isolation  ward. I had pneumonia, this decision could of killed me. And they knew I had a lung problem.It took me threatening to sue until they put me in a private room where I spent 7 days on 2 different antibiotics, O2 and pain meds to get better. I was also never told how this could happen to someone who was my age and never had health issues.(You were lucky to see a DR once a day) and if you did they would show up at the crack of dawn when you were half asleep and unable to ask the serious questions about your healthcare. Only good thing was the ward I was in the nurses were amazing gems who actually cared and went above and beyond for me and made me feel like I mattered. In conclusion  for the love of god, go to another hospital, I would never wish what I went through on my worst enemy. Its disgusting and sickening that people who go to a hospital to get help are treated like this. I can only imagine what happens to people who don't have a voice online or can give there story."

I never met her before, she must be a doctor or a personnel of that hospital. thanks very much.
Then when I stepped in ultrasound room a very kind and beautiful medical assistant helped me to get ready for my procedure, she explained clearly every step of the procedure.

Stretches me cheek looking around. After about 5  mins I ask him, “what do you think, or see”. He replies with “I’m not sure, I’m not a dentist”. So I said when is the dentist coming; he tells me “we don’t have dentists here, only if we really need them in an emergency. Your staff wasted my time while I was in pain, and I will never be back here again. I have not advised anyone to go here. I asked them why would you tell me come if you have no dentist?

People = overall good

Had a pleasant experience for the most part, however, miscommunications still arose. For example, I had a tube in my arm and was instructed to leave it there for repeat blood work that was scheduled to take place in 4 hours. However, when I had this bloodwork, the caretaker took it from the other arm saying that she wouldn’t use the uncomfortable tube I had to leave in for these four hours. Thanks for considering this feedback, otherwise thanks for the care.

Feedback on AIDET communications commitments:

Got the acknowledgement down

Introductions with caregivers name and professional designation were few and far between aside from the doctor.

Duration - staff underestimated times especially towards the end of the visit (40 min became 2 hours) and no updates were provided

About half the time staff explained what was going to happen next. Not a great track record but satisfactory. I often took the initiative to ask, and they were informative.

There was no wrap up “Thank you” at the end.

Also, despite dismissing the primary concern of a heart attack, no explanation was provided as to what could be causing the other symptoms of dizziness and fatigue."

My foot was swollen and they took an x-ray and saw broken bones, they decided to put a boot on it, send me to physical therapy and another 4 weeks of recovery.  This month, I went to the hospital again and they decided to spend more time with the boot and do an MIR that should have been done in the first 4 to 6 weeks.  They said he would ""possibly"" have a muscle or tendon tear.  With all this, 4 months have passed and I still don't know what I have on my foot.  They sent me home and said they would call and schedule the MIR.  In conclusion, two days passed and I hadn't received any calls, I called the hospital and they said they would only have space for December 28th and that I would have another appointment with the doctor in January.

The most patient midwife I met was Dr. Daniel Bierstene (sorry if I called you Miss, I was confused on how and what to call you) who explained everything to me starting from the induced labor, what medications they put in IV, gave me water or juice and a big birth ball to have me fully dilated and ready for giving birth. The most calming, therapeutic, and smart ones too are Ms. Thuy and Ms. Iasmin. These are just some of the ones I got to meet and say thank you to. I still wanna thank all of them that is why I am writing this because I admire how considerate, caring, professional all the staff of St. Joe's are.

It has my ideal kind of clean when it comes to going to hospitals! It just feels nice to be there when first, the place is clean. And second, the people are caring. I love this hospital and if I would give birth, I would like it to be here again only because of the factors I above-mentioned.

P.S. I would like to thank my OB too, Dr. Adam Rosen for being a humble and cool doctor. He is a very knowledgeable OB, glad that St. Joe has him. Also, Ms. Ruby of Dr. Saranggapani's clinic and Dr. Saranggapani where I go for checkup/appointments--- I would like to acknowledge their hardwork."

My spouse had a surgery on his shoulder at St Joe's last week. Everything went very well, Dr Wood is a very experienced surgeon and caring doctor. Fracture and orthopaedic clinic works very efficiently, people do not seat in the line for half a day. Follow up appointments get booked fast too. Also I am very grateful to all the nurses at the Barnicke wing 2nd fl day of surgery, both  operating and recovery and ICU, for taking such a good care of us!

Watch out for Dr Anand (ortho as well) though, he might tell you stories about the research when AC separated joints in shoulders heal w/o surgery just fine (when your shoulder is in fact deformed and not in place, and you are in great pain), and your biggest problem after your shoulder heals this way would be inability to wear a backpack....

I gave birth at St Joe's in 2010 and 2015, both times experience was very positive. Both my pregnancies were 100% no problem, childbirth with no complications, so I cannot comment on how they operate under more complex circumstances. However, Dr Melchior was and is a highly professional and outgoing specialist.

Unfortunately, I cannot say good things re cancer screening department which my initial 1-star review was about. I was referred to do the mammogram in August 2022, and there was no phone calls to schedule an appointment for a month. I spent 2 weeks trying to schedule it myself, no one answered the phone and no one returned me a call when I left a message. So I went to Credit Valley Hospital instead. I got a call back within a week, scheduled my mammogram in the 1st week of October, and got the results back fairly quick. On January 31, 2023 St Joe's called me to schedule my mammogram.... If I did have a breast cancer, it would have moved to the next stage by that time. Very disappointing."

Response to owner: No I will NOT be contacting Patient Relations. I see reviews like mine dating back months. If you were serious about rectifying the ER situation you would have done so by now and I would not have had that horrific experience last night. Your concern is hollow. I will not waste another minute of my time. I requested a referral from my family doctor this morning to a hospital or clinic that actually cares about their patients."

Get your family member off this floor as soon as possible! The staff have caused me immense anxiety and sleepless nights. I have volunteered at hospitals before and have never encountered staff as immature and unprofessional as I have on the 2nd floor of this hospital.
My mother developed extremely bad bed sores all over her bottom because she was left in WET underwear at this hospital. TWO months later the rash is only now starting to clear up.
Patient relations was useless in helping me with this situation. They were aware of what I had experienced but provided me with NO support.
My mom was in Emergency for 2 days and they lost all her clothes and very expensive shoes! My moms feet are in bad condition so we had her shoes imported from Germany. Does My mom return home in a hospital gown and bare feet?!  Look elsewhere for a good hospital as St. Joseph's is the WORST one I have experienced thus far!!!!!!!"

In all due respect I just left 7 hours prior. as the department was closed until later that morning.

It has nothing to do with the staff- except maybe some select admin staff what were rude for no reason, the nurses were fantastic. Overall, they are trying to do their best with as much funding provided. Although, Hospital management was terrible. We saw a dead body being moved in the hallway right beside the pre-surgery registration area.  Toilets in surgery recovery rooms are soiled and not cleaned between patients (who are not required to wear a mask after surgery). Toilets outside for family members of the patients are also soiled and smelly and doors are wide open to get that nice breeze.  Covid patients are on the same floor as surgical patients, and doors in-between are wide open.  Again for the Covid virus to get that fresh air, i guess. My daughter had a surgery and unfortunately it was scheduled here. It was supposed to be 2 hours surgery and lasted for more than 3 hours and I was left to cry and all panic outside without straight answer from the reception. I  know that may be they don't know what's going on inside or they're not allowed to say it but some reassurance would have been helpful to reduce panic level.  Imagine your loved ones life is in the hands of this kind of poorly managed and maintained hospital. Hygiene of the hospital made me uncomfortable the most.  Nurses and other staff, I saw several times dropped the things on a floor and just picked it up and walked.  No cleaning,  no washing,  sanitizing,  nothing.  And I'm talking about surgery unit, so you can imagine the hygiene of the rest of the hospital. Please think twice before booking surgery for yourself or your loved ones.

My grandma who does not speak English was admitted here until the end of her time. No interpreter services was provided to her since admission. Because of the no visitor policy, she had no idea why she was in the hospital or what was happening to her. The clock in her room wasn’t even working, she had no way of telling the days or the times or anything. As the days went by, her arms showed more and more bruises which were left unexplained. It was worse than a prison. Staff were also uncompromising and inconsiderate of family dynamics--they put in zero effort to get to know and understand the family.

Severe neglect. We had a eVisiting Zoom call and watched her get up and fall from her bed despite us calling the Front Desk prior to request a nurse to enter the room to help her use the washroom. 2 phone calls and 15 minutes later, they came. We asked what happened and they were evasive and rude. No accountability and all patient shame. What kind of palliative care is this? Even when this encounter was reported to the manager, there was no follow-up whatsoever. An absolute disappointment.

The screening team is also terrible and does little to welcome you to the hospital. If anything, they’re worse than the bouncers at the club. They will do everything in their capacity to upset you despite the circumstances and will greet you with all the doubt in the world. Why else would anyone show up to the hospital if they weren’t already approved to visit the patient? Screening team needs to learn a thing or two about customer service.

Don’t bother telling me to contact Patient Relations because nothing productive will come out of it. I’ve had my fair share of experiences with this department. This hospital needs to re-evaluate their values and missions statement because they’re all talk and no game."

Emerg staff are terrific. Especially the nurses. Wait times suck. But the staff are off the charts kind and competent. Someone should win the lottery and donate a gorgeous staff lounge.

Inpatient staff are almost all terrific. Good, competent doctors with great follow-up and good admin staff. Occasional bad apple nurse seems to persist due to seniority.

Maternity is mostly great. Like the other inpatient nurses, 90% amazing, 5% laissez-faire, and 5% seniority protected. Great delivery staff.

The work is physically and emotionally draining but the staffs show up for work every day taking care of our mom with compassion and care, and allowing her to pass peacefully. Thank you everyone at 6M, you are the unsung heroes.

We were in the middle of seeing a doctor and got interrupted, the doctor and nurses disappeared for an hr and when they returned we were forgotten until I reminded them that we’re still in the queue. Later we were asked to come back the next day because the CT scan service is closing. We got the scan done the next day and then were asked to go to emergency to register again to see a doctor. With all the brain power in this place this is the most efficient process they can come up with. How about try register patients first before doing a scan and not the other way around."

hours. I asked how much longer and the nurse was so rude. They staff have a ""I don't care"" attitude. The hospital is disgusting and patients are packed in the waiting area like sardines. One nurse was too busy on her phone, she got in trouble from a doctor for inputting the wrong patient information. I would rather pay for health care than come back to this nasty emergency room."

Then they do an ultrasound and from there the doctor tells me that today, May 16, a surgeon would contact me because they should do a procedure and they DIDN'T do it, apart from all the man who admitted me was upset, he was clear in his face, because he did not understand his English ... it is not fair that he has such bad attention, one does not go to the emergency room for fun and less with this pandemic situation, I really feel bad and I do not want to go back to that hospital with that Very bad attention from all! the only people who behaved well with me were the ultrasound ladies .... I think it's serious that they prescribe morphine for pain when the first doctor asked me and I told him that this medicine made me feel very bad ..."

Yesterday, my grandmother visited my sister and after 5 minutes I had to leave the nursing home because a 25-year-old nurse said while they were eating cake. Suddenly 5 nurses appeared and surrounded my great-grandmother and sent her home!!! After 5 minutes because the nurse had a bad day. Then my aunt saw that Kriszti was being surrounded and one of the nurses raised her hand. I stone the video recordings because they are abusing my brother!!!!"
