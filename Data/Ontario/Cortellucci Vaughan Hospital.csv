She has leukemia, and we thought it was the chemo. Turns out she has heart failure, which the ER diagnosed immediately. She was admitted within 30 minutes, and the doctor said he would ""fix"" her.  2 weeks later, and she is doing amazing! The doctor did not lie. The rooms are impeccably clean and comfortable. The nurses do everything with a smile and are so caring. Cortellucci saved my mom's life, and we are forever grateful!"

Although we get the right treatment eventually, I always notice that majority of the staff is so unfriendly and it seems like they are serving jail time and are forced to do the job. There are always some very nice people in the staff too.
Overall, there is room for improvement starting with training staff to be nice and empathetic to patients who come to ER."

I have had to go to this ER on 3 different occasions now for 3 different issues and the story is the same. The nurses lack any sort of compassion, seem to have little nursing experience and are very poorly trained. They are understaffed no matter what time of day you go into the department. Even though it is the closest emergency department for most people in the Vaughan area, you’re better off elsewhere. The nurses should not be in this line of work with the lack of human decency that 4/5 of them seem to have."

My 2-year old was experiencing a severe infection in her mouth that prevented her from eating and drinking due to major pain and bleeding. After an initial misdiagnosis of strep throat, and 5 days of antibiotics that did not improve her conditions, I took her to this emergency. She was napping on the hospital bed when the doctor entered her room. He woke her up and immediately tried to pry open her mouth, which clearly startled her. No introductions, no explanation of what he was going to do, no trying to put her at ease. Nothing. She freaked out (which is understandable). He was clearly frustrated by her lack of cooperation (sighing, getting agitated in his tone and demeanor, etc.) and kept insisting that I hold her down or else he couldn't do his assessment. I was unable to calm her, so he recruited hospital staff to assist. He had us physically restrain her while she thrashed and screamed, which still didn't work. He didn't even clean up the blood that filled her mouth and was running down her chin from his forceful efforts - I had to request Kleenex and clean her up myself. In the end, I opted to sedate her because she was terrified of him. It was a trauma! He was arrogant, showed almost zero empathy or compassion, and clearly did not know how to make a child feel comfortable and safe in his care.

I give 2 stars here - one for the sweet and gentle nurse that did eventually come and prep my daughter for sedation. And the other for the fact that we got a proper diagnosis and she is getting better. Otherwise ... I would not recommend taking your small children here. Or at least, avoid Dr. Fu if you do have small kids. He needs some additional training in bedside manner and working with small children.

FYI I drove from Newmarket because I was told this hospital was ""state of the art"" and came highly recommended. I regret making the extra effort given the treatment we received."

It's disgusting what people are expecting. Have some patience and respect, maybe you'll receive better care. I have received numerous treatments at Cortellucci and have been admitted here several times. This is the most advanced hospital I have seen. It should be utilized more. For this visit I was admitted to the Surgery Unit (8D) and had amazing nurses. Dr. Fiture performed surgery and although there were complications, I am very grateful to him and his team. He checked on me every day to make sure I was OK. Thank you to Vaughan Cortellucci for providing such great CARE. Please utilize this hospital more. It's a shame that other hospitals are packed and under-staffed when this seems almost the exact opposite. The amount of staff I saw just kind of walking around is kind of absurd but I'm glad to have such a nice hospital to visit."

I would like to say many of the nurses on this floor have a bad attitude. My first night on the floor I was approached by a nurse who was hostile and told me she would appreciate it if I left, telling me I need to answer her questions (I was answering), why am I still here etc. She was upset to see me there at a late hour when I was not yet told about the rules on this floor. Additionally while my family member was in the emergency room mental health section she was not allowed a table to feed herself/ drink, she has a disability and is half paralyzed. There are certain things she needs to aid herself with everyday tasks. There also isn’t a lift for people who need to be lifted into a wheelchair. There reasoning is “most people like my family member are in the medical part of the hospital” which is unacceptable because most people with disabilities also have mental health concerns. She shouldn’t have to be bed bound for three plus weeks while others get to walk around, talk with others, watch TV and get snacks. This section needs to be more inclusive, there is a duty to accommodate people with disabilities. It doesn’t help peoples mental health to take away their aids, ability to feed and drink on their own on top of the fact that she isn’t able to see the time in her room which would relieve anxiety for her as her bed is placed in the opposite direction of the time. Hopefully this hospital can consider being more inclusive in the mental health section of the hospital, as well as considering training for staff on interpersonal skills and communication."

Others experiences may be different and they are valid as well but these are mine.

I have been rpd, assaulted, misunderstood by police, lawyers, family and friends, had a knife to my throat, and never have I been so traumatized as when my family member was in this hospital.
At a time when he needs me most, at a time when his life is hanging by a thread and there is only a 50/50 that he will make it, I was forbidden from seeing him.
If you think that is bad and you don't know how you would hold it together in a moment like that it got worse.
I was escorted out by SECURITY, under threat of LAW ENFORCEMNENT, WITHOUT  being told why this is happening. Not only did they decide my mental health state for me but they are actively working on revoking my decision making ability, because NONE of them talk to me about ANY situation where THEY felt uncomfortable.
Yet they expected ME a GREIVING child, to hold it together , and be composed, dignified, and poised. I am sorry but I am not a queen, an actress or a sociopath I am a regular person with flaws, fighting for her fathers life and death with dignity."

Better off at any other hospital no matter how long you think the wait may be. Was here for 4.5 hours today. Waited to be taken into an ultrasound for 4 hours. Was told I was next in the ultrasound for 2 hours. I asked for my other test results just to have a look to see if they were sufficient enough to come to a diagnosis but no one even looked they just said it is not possible without even talking to the doctor first. I was told I waited so long to wait a little longer so they can call up to see, no one ever called. I was persuaded to stay multiple times with no actions being taken. I sat in the same chair for 4 hours without contact from anyone, I left once the doctors and nurses changed shifts because I knew I would be there all night after being there all day. Best of all I was recommended to the emergency room by urgent care and still was not seen. If you sign an AMG to leave meaning you leave without being seen they don’t send any of your test results to my chart wasting tax payers money, making it impossible for another doctor to treat you without having to run the same test. Worst hospital in Ontario. Highly do not recommend. Go to another hospital this place is a waste of time and money. You pay for hours of parking for no reason. They should get rid of the emergency department because they do not act in a timely fashion or organized manner what so ever. My nurse who took my blood was good, that is it."

Nurses speak very loudly and continuously using their cell phones. Returning home, we found among the documents a prescription that is not ours (another patient prescription, which is a serious issue). Finally, arriving home (7 minutes from the hospital) my wife was bleeding and all her clothes full of blood from the effect of bad removal of the canula.
We need to restart the journey in another hospital since we did not receive a proper diagnosis or treatment. If every person does that because of the bad service that means the load and cost on the health system is doubled. Better improve the service and ensure professional behavior of Doctors and staff."

I've always heard that the waiting time at ER is very extensive and I was somehow prepared for that. When I entered the lobby, I had to get the number from the kiosk which is the reason why I'm giving a four star review because the ticket printer is almost at the ground level which is really hard for someone who hurt their back like me to reach for it. I waited in the lobby for registration, then wait for pre-screen to appoint me to a room, then waited in the room among with other patients, then a nurse come to asked a bit more questions, then finally doctor called me to a room for checking. I would say the entire process was very organized and I got the ticket at 8: 55pm and was able to see the doctor around 10: 30pm. For minor treatment waiting time at ER I would say is reasonable. I saw an elderly lady she went to the waiting room for ambulatory before me and was still waiting when I was leaving so not sure about other rooms' waiting time.
We paid $16 for the parking for almost two hours."

September 15th i went into the hospital for an induction. Everything was going well. I had excellent staff working with me except one lady she was of Asian decent and had a really bad attitude. My first time giving birth i would think she would have a bit more consideration. The attitude problem was not the worst of it. She made my newborn daughter go into the ICU with low blood sugar because she refused to give me formula for her. 4 hours after she was born she was not getting any milk from me (her mother) from being breastfed so i asked if i can have formula to that one particular nurse that had the bad attitude and she stated ""shes sleeping, she doesnt need milk, do you like being woken up to eat when you are sleeping? those were her exact words. I was very hurt. Another nurse came to check her blood sugar and it was below 1 she immediately had to go into the ICU where i did not get to see my newborn daughter over night i was heartbroken and distraught. I asked another nurse to report her. She was the reason my newborn baby had low blood sugar because she needed milk. Once the ICU nurse gave her milk her blood sugar went back to normal. Now shes 2 years old and fine but i never got to state my case with this and it has been bothering me ever since it happened. I hope that nurse is removed from the hospital or gets proper training because she does not belong in that department."

I brought my mother for a CT scan. Obviously, it’s a new hospital, very bright & shiny. But what’s impressive is that it seems to have comprehensive patient flow systems that actually work. Navigating my 80+ mother from online registration, in person registration, imaging reception, treatment, post treatment observation; there was a seamless effortless choreography of admin and medical staff that all seemed to anticipate and know why my mother was there. The care was gentle, empathetic and careful. For sure, this hospital does not seem to be under stress of overload of patients as in many older hospitals, but this was very impressive. I have some experience with physicians & legal matters with hospitals. So I know this is very demanding and I hope this level of service can be maintained!"

The nurses were unprofessional and seemed uninterested in helping us or providing any updates. The wait for the doctors was unbearable. This experience has been incredibly stressful and frustrating, and I would not recommend this hospital to anyone. They clearly do not prioritize their patients' well-being.

There is no management to control who is doing there job and most of the staffs are rude and unprofessional.

In the whole hospital they only have one paediatric. The nurses are super bad and absolutely unprofessional, four of them came during four hours to just take some blood  unfortunately they could not find the vein which is unacceptable and very disappointing for a big hospital like this.

I urge government officials to intervene and take control of the services and quality at this hospital. Patients deserve timely and professional care, especially in urgent situations. This experience has been incredibly stressful and frustrating, and I would not recommend this hospital to anyone."

We arrived at the hospital around eight in the morning. Check-in went smoothly. However, for whatever reason the OB seem to think it wasn’t labor. She thought instead it might be a UTI, but it clearly was not. She had us wait until 4 o’clock in the afternoon While my wife was having contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for about 12 hours with no pain medication. I found this to be unnecessary suffering, especially given we were just a few days away from the scheduled C-section anyways. We had asked for an epidural, but she never got one.

When it came into the recovery. The daytime nurses did what you would expect them to do and I am thankful that they were there to do their jobs. The night time nursing staff were quite frankly unprofessional, and I don’t think they take their job seriously. The overwhelming impression I got was that they were there just a punch in a clock and punch out a clock, and we’re hoping to end their shift as quickly as they could. Too many examples to list, but what really got me was them having casual conversations loudly in the hallways in the middle of the night with babies and mothers trying to recover. Barging into the room just to give a couple Tylenol in the wee hours of the morning, waking all of us up. Instead of being supportive criticizing, and trying to make fun of me while I was struggling to change the babies diaper, and the only reason why I was struggling to change the diaper is this hospital doesn’t want to provide you with any supplies that includes wipes, pads, formula, nipples, the whole deal. If you do want something you have to beg and plead and they reprimand you and tell you that you should’ve brought things with you. This to me is comparable to going to a restaurant and a waitress getting upset with you because you didn’t bring your plate fork and knife from home to the restaurant with you.

I probably give this hospital a four stars if the evening nursing staff were half decent and the OB  Didn’t extend the time it took to do the C-section by six hours.

I should add that we had our first baby at the same hospital in December 2022. The experience at that time was much much better. I don’t know what happened to the staff, the supplies, and the general attitude of the doctors and staff at this hospital, but it’s taken a huge downhill turn in my opinion in a very short amount of time. For our third child, we will try to find somewhere else to go. I just feel bad for the one out of five nurses who are actually good at what they do and care. The rest of the staff must really bring morale down."

I know that they have this kind of attitude  & disrespect for people, I told my parents not to ask for help from them or else they will give attitude when they come to the room nor will they even acknowledge with some type of response, so I told them to wait for me or call me directly & I will come right away to help them shower, wipe down, & go to the toilet. For kids, you would expect them to be more kind & understanding towards kids because kids do not understand the situation & is easily scared but I can't believe the atrocious behaviour the nurses at the emergency were behaving giving my son dirty looks, rolling their eyes like as if its such a burden to deal with & talk to my kid agressively asking him why he is screaming or crying as 3 of them pin him down, he is already not moving, just only crying & screaming, i already said he is non verbal with autism but come on , IT IS A KID!!! like WHAT DO YOU EXPECT from a kid who is getting all these nurses come in to poke him in his hands & arms all over leaving bruises & not able to give I.v the doctor has ask them too because you are incompetent to find the veins with your long fake nails? the professionalism is non-existent with these nurses too, why are you guys complaining about each others work WHILE doing the patients bloodwork? One nurse Erin & the Indian charge nurse were talking bad about the younger white nurse & her work, I don't care what you have to talk about your coworkers, wait till you are done & go out  & talk among yourselves about each other. I do not understand why these people are in this profession in the first place, gets paid alot of money are so cranky & saying things like ""another day for the paycheque"". One incident where this nurse in the emergency YANK off the blood & iv that was in my arm & my mom's because I ask if there was xray result yet, I was already there for 12 hours & have work at 7am, she had a piss off look & lift her legs off the doctor & gave us a dirty look & left me & my mom arms with a huge bruise. I should have filed a complaint, but I didn't, but I will for sure next time when I encounter these people. Out of all my experiences there was only 1 Doctor that actually spoke to me like a human should be spoken to & 1 very young nurse on level 7 that helped one of the day shifts that was polite to me & my dad, i dont expect level 100 service of any sort but treat people how they should be treated. If the patient or family is being rude then I can understand why the nurses or doctors are acting this way but why the hostility when no one has done you wrong? also most times they come into the patients room, no introduction no greeting and just stare you down & say ""check vitals"" & then chart the info on the computer & leave the room. Is this our Canadian Healthcare suppose to be? Everytime I see the monitor that shows a message that says that they don't tolerate physical & verbal abuse I find it laughable, look at your staff & what they are doing? I heard one nurse yelled at the older gentlemen that is staying across from our room, poor man. Waiting more than 8hrs each emergency visit is not the issue for me because I expected it, a lot of people comes in, but no compassion & rude behavior is not a valid excuse due to high capacity of patients.

However, the most disappointing aspect of my experience was that my partner was not allowed to join me in the room for the ultrasound, even though there was plenty of space and extra chairs available.

Pregnancy is an experience I want to share with my partner, and every other ultrasound and appointment during this pregnancy has allowed him to be by my side. It felt like the staff were more focused on strict protocols than on providing a patient-centered experience.

Overall, this was not the best first impression. Its making me reconsider whether or not this is where I want to deliver my baby.  I hope the hospital considers being more accommodating in the future."

My grandfather is currently at Cortellucci hospital and he had a very unfortunate incident last night. My grandfather has been suffering with strokes for the past few months and was rushed to hospital on Sunday. Yesterday evening around midnight, a nurse asked if he recognized where he was and he said ""at home"" instead of the hospital. Suddenly, the nurse started screaming at him ""you're disoriented!"" And called for support where 12 individuals came and held him down, strapped him to the bed, and sat on his arms. He was saying ""stop you're hurting me"" and they still held my ALMOST EIGHTY year old grandfather down for trying to stand up. He pulled his arm out of their grasp and accidently hit one of the TWELVE nurses (excessive much?) who were restraining him. Absolutely despicable behaviour. Do not go to Cortellucci."

Be prepared to wait minimum of 6 hours regardless of your health issue. Breathing issues and difficulty isn’t considered “serious”. I understand how triage works and it’s based on severity of the issue but respiratory issues should definitely be prioritized. Told the nurse I could be having an allergic reaction and she said go to ambulatory there’s 20 people ahead of you.
Some staff members are really rude and shouldn’t be in the medical field. Learn some manners and the attitude isn’t necessary. If you don’t want to deal with aching or frustrated sick people than I suggest a different field of work. There’s only  1 doctor to help 30+ patients in a hospital that is supposed to cover the whole jurisdiction of Vaughan.  That’s completely ridiculous there’s more doctors at a walk in! Also not interested in a pathetic reply “sorry for the long wait times” there’s no excuse for the attitude from the staff. They seem to respond by saying “we understand the wait times are not ideal……but are staff members are working as quickly as possible” this is the furthest from the truth.  No compassion for the patients what so ever. My father had a heart attack and we had to yell at the staff for them to acknowledge him. Disgusted in this hospital and our healthcare system. They cover up the negative reviews with lame responses meanwhile most people are complaining about the wait time and staff. The wait times maybe we can’t control but the unprofessional staff should be dealt with"

Today, they directed us to the ambulatory department when my mom was struggling to breathe and having trouble swallowing. As she came out of the restroom and attempted to sit, she fainted because of her difficulty breathing. I was frantic, yelling for help, but the nurses seemed indifferent until I insisted they bring a stretcher. Most of them appeared uncaring, except for one nurse who showed kindness. Shockingly, some nurses even questioned whether my mom had fainted on purpose. After a long wait, we finally saw a doctor who callously stated, ""I am an emergency doctor; unless you're dying in the next three hours, I cannot help you."" This statement was beyond belief—life is unpredictable, and when someone is in pain, the hospital should be the last place where they feel neglected.

Plus there is a very RUDE ‘nurse’ her clothes colour was all PINK. I asked her politely when will doctor come to my room and tell me the results since I have been waiting for like 3 hours and she said he will be with you shortly go in the waiting room and don’t stand at my back. Who do you think you are? She also said to another patient who clearly didn’t speak much English : if you don’t want to wait you are more than welcome to go. She was literally screaming to an elderly lady. Be ashamed of your self, just because you are qualified to be a nurse it doesn’t give you the right to act like this.

She accused us of coming from Newmarket with disrespectful behavior and stated that the department was extremely busy. When we explained that we were patients, she dismissed our concerns.

Later, she returned to draw blood and applied extreme pressure to my wife's arm. When my wife complained, the nurse told her to do it herself and displayed a dismissive attitude. When I intervened, the nurse raised her voice and violated hospital rules. She even called security on me without cause. Despite security backing me, I decided to leave the hospital.

The emergency doctor was quick in his diagnosis and my husband was admitted.

The cardiac nurses and doctors  were great at all times medications ,procedures and test were explained thoroughly. At no time you felt restricted to ask a question regarding an ongoing issue.
There are some things I really love at this hospital since I have gone to many hospitals previously.

I love how staff are forthcoming with information , they are generally concern with the patient’s well being and the family comfort and comprehension of what is currently occurring. Also, the technology attached to work no medication can be given to patient at bedside unless both medication and patient wrist scanned and clearance is given by the computer. Less of chance of mistake by using both the nurse visual and computer.

A computer is in each room for nurses to enter and quickly achess all information from vitals, update patient’s history immediately prior to leaving room so everyone has access virtually to same information. Lastly, patient have a tablet in the room to get educated on their medication, safety topics for in and out hospital care ,order meals for the day according to their choice, give feed back on any of the services received.

The only negative in the stay at the hospital is the parking fee after 2 weeks."

His suggestion was that I slept wrong and said if I really wanted to I could get an xray I then expressed that my sumptuous are worsening and I have a family history with blood clots he then proceeded to give attitude and walk out of the room. After advocating for an ultrasound he agreed to send me (around 8:40). I then proceeded to wait 2 hours to be seen by the ultrasoundist that tells me that he had been calling me for an hour even thought I asked the nurse twice if I was called. I went back to ambulatory to proceed to wait another 3 hours I asked the doctor for pain medication and he said what do you have at home(I’m in the hospital waiting and you can’t even give me meds for pain), then I hear that the results had nothings wrong and that I should talk to my family doctor.

The emergency proceedings are very efficient and i was treated with the care and urgency my situation required.
While in emergency I was put through a number of tests, seen by different Doctors who were specialists in their field and later admitted.
The staff on the 7TH floor were amazing! I was quickly seen by DR, Fiture and within two days he performed emergency surgery. The speed at which all of this happened was such a comfort to myself and my family.
I had a short stay in the ICU unit where I received the utmost care and service. Again, my family and I have only high praise for the ICU unit.
Next I was received on the 8th floor for the remainder of my stay,
The nurses there are all wonderful. The nurses charged with my care were well informed of every detail of my condition, Doctor's instructions and what I would be facing in terms of future treatments, NO questions were stupid or went unanswered.
There are two nurses in particular that deserve honorable mention and they are Ellie and Marjorie. They are a gift to their craft and a blessing to anyone lucky enough to be cared for by them. MY family and I would like to extend a special thank you to Ellie and Marjorie for their loving care.

Thanks to everyone at Cortellucci Hospital Vaughan for making my situation and my stay the best it could be.

My experience was overwhelmingly positive, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts.

From the moment I arrived, the hospital's cleanliness, well-organized and the modernity of its facilities stood out. The room I stayed in was comfortable, well-maintained, and equipped with all the necessary amenities.

The staff, from the nurses to the medical team, were exceptional. Dr. Roushdi, Dr. Wang, … and Nurse Jennifer, and Nurse Michelle from NICU, Nurse Kristina, Nurse Vanessa, and Nurse Hailey  in Pediatrician department were particularly outstanding. They were not only highly professional and knowledgeable but also showed genuine care and concern for well-being of my child. I was always informed about my treatment plan, and any questions I had were answered promptly and clearly.

Nurse Kristina Au is an invaluable asset to the pediatric department for the outstanding care and compassion she consistently provides.

During our recent visit, Kristina went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and safe. Her experience and deep knowledge eased our anxiety and made a significant difference in our experience. For instance, Kristina took extra time to explain us different methods of breast feeding in a way that was understandable for me and comforting to my baby.

Kristina not only demonstrates exceptional clinical skills but also embodies the qualities of empathy and patience that are crucial in pediatric care. Her ability to connect with patients and their families and provide individualized attention is truly remarkable. On multiple occasions, she has provided us with invaluable advice and support, making us feel confident and cared for.

Her commitment to providing exceptional care and her genuine compassion make her a standout nurse. I wholeheartedly recommend her for any recognition."

Yet when he said this, about 3 other staff turned around and left the room. When asked for a confidential appointment, he said that I would have to reschedule my appointment. Thankfully I’m aware of my rights, as I work in this field, thus I vocalized this. This hospital is not adequate enough to support mental health! Additionally, on my second visit, the nursing staff was unprofessional and rude (Brian, whose name I asked for under his ‘non-therapeutic and unprofessional’ care), while the doctors did NO physical examination and instead asked about medication. My medication, to make matters worse, was completely inaccurate in my discharge summary and I also missed 2 doses of medication while in the ER….despite knowing my medication. Next, I have experienced multiple forms of homophobia while being treated at this hospital, which can even be evident from my discharge summary. Even when being wheeled in by paramedics, the paramedic shared that I’m not the only patient/staff to report this (the lack of safety felt in the first visit of, only reaffirmed in the second vist). A new hospital with dated values & ideals, Standards of Care, and doctor’s Standard of Practice! I suggest going anywhere else to avoid similar experiences and associated traumas. I will be writing/following up with MacKenzie Health’s Patient Relations Department, especially as reading the hospital’s replies to people’s complaints are responded to with a generic email that they ‘hope to provide a a certain type of care’, but what happens when this repeatedly isn’t the case?!?"

I was assessed and admitted into the minor injury unit right away. The nurses and doctor on staff were very caring and helped me through the whole procedure. I was in and out in around 2 hours.

I had preregistered and had my interviews with the nurse and anaesthetist prior to surgery. I was visited by each again and heard so many versions of what course of action they were going to take. Then a nurse came in to hook me up for the drug line and missed the vein. Then another nurse told her not to set me up for IV antibiotics just a line for anaesthetics. Do you think she could have read the orders before poking a hole in my arm and missing. Then the same nurse went to my other side and managed to put a line into my hand. It was NOT painless. Then I waited to be taken into the operating room. What a shit show that was. There had to be 4 or 5 staff hovering around me and rushing me to slide over onto the operating table. All the while with mask, hookup line in my hand, gown opening and they were reaching every which way over me and around me to begin surgery. I was so flustered I wanted to jump off that table. I may have said something actually like slowdown. The surgery began late as well. Although I had been told twice that the surgeon was ahead of schedule.
The first impression entering the hospital wasn't bad but the fiasco in the prep area and operating room was bizarre. I was getting a bad vibe. Thankfully the surgeon and the anesthesiologist were competent.
The parking situation is awful.

Due to popliteal artery stenosis caused by arterial dissection in my left leg, I had very severe pain in my leg, and after a vascular ultrasound, the vascular surgeon said that 75% of the arteries were narrowed. Additionally, due to a skin infection caused by erythema nodosum, I had bruises all over my legs and was accompanied by severe heat and pain. To put it simply, two diseases hit one leg. The specialist said I needed surgery and medication, but I needed to get a CT scan first. Two months passed and there was no news. Bruising started all over my legs, so I went to the emergency room. The doctor I saw in the emergency room was terrible. The doctor appeared to be a tall and bulky Filipino of Asian descent, and his attitude and tone toward the patient were disgusting.He asked me if there was a specialist, and I explained the situation and that I was waiting for a CT scan, but my legs were hurting so bad and I was starting to get bruises all over my legs. But the doctor was sarcastic and said something I couldn't believe. “You can’t do surgeon shopping” Those were truly disgusting words. He also repeated that even if he had a CT scan, he had no knowledge of blood vessels and there was no vascular doctor at McKenzie Hospital, so there was nothing he could do. It was like admitting that he was an incompetent doctor, and even though he had no skills, the way he treated patients as a doctor was truly disgusting. A doctor with no skills and a bad attitude. It makes one question whether this doctor is really a doctor who saves people or a doctor who kills them. Due to the shock of that day, I immediately flew to Korea, where I am receiving balloon dilation and stent procedures, and for skin tissue infection, I am receiving biopsy and drug treatment in parallel.The doctors I met here said that it was a very urgent situation and that procedures, surgery, and drug treatment were needed as soon as possible. I can't believe that such a large and good hospital has a doctor who is so ignorant and incompetent, and whose attitude towards patients is so disgusting. I have visited McKenzie Hospital several times and have had procedures done, and it has been a good experience every time, but it makes me very angry to think that patients may be harmed by doctors like this. These unproven doctors are dangerous to patients. I would like to take legal action and file a complaint, but I am currently unable to do so because my body is so ill, and I hope that no patient is harmed by that ignorant doctor."

I’m extremely disappointed w my experience. I waited for 6 hours w an awful wheezing painful congested chest to get a puffer or some medication to help with my breathing. They did a ecg, bloodwork and an xray then the doctor immediately dismissed me without even seeing me. The discharge nurse told me “the dr said everything’s fine, he has to take care of more critical patients”  the doctor didn’t prescribe me any medication or puffers and just told me to “rest”. He didn’t ask if I had questions, if there’s anything off the counter for me to use to help alleviate my pain. I felt very dismissed and disrespected. The dr who failed to provide me w proper health care and guidance was md: lavelle conor . There was also a nurse who I asked if I can have a snack or a cracker because I felt extremely nauseous from all my coughing and felt my blood sugar dropping. He told me “you’re getting discharged anyway”. I had to ask another nurse to get me something to eat. It’s as if I was asking him to go into a kitchen and make me a meal. I didn’t catch his name but he was working the day shift on Tuesday sept 5. He was tall Caucasian with black hair braided into corn rows. This hospitals staff needs to better. When you take an oath to take care of patients, the least you can do is acknowledge us when we’re in pain and actually help. I wasted more than half my day here only to leave with no answers, no help and no reassurance.

I will not be coming back."

I was very disappointed with treatment received in Minor Treatment department.
The check in was very fast and professional. I did Xray, it went really well.
When I went to Minor Treatment department, I was called in to see the doctor, the doctor asked me to remove the dressing from my finger, I removed the dressing MY SELF struggling as the wound was very sensitive. The doctor asked me to tell him what happened, I started explaining to him for maybe 5 seconds and he got a phone call, he asked me to leave the room and go to another room and wait. I noticed, the doctor was busy with his cell phone, the assistant was busy on her cell phone and I was not even listened to what happened with my injury. Very unprofessional staff in this department in such a nice hospital.
A nurse came and put new dressing on my finger and I was referred to a plastic surgent. So the doctor never listened to me properly and never explained properly as he was too busy with his cell phone.

I really hope someone responsible reads this review and such cell phone addicts should not be using cell phone and patients should get proper treatment."

Then they come rushing with a machine for me to pay $350 upfront for the doctor. I paid it. We were already traumatized from our accident and couldn’t think clearly. Triage person said to contact account department to see if the bill can be adjusted and gave me a card. They show zero compassion and empathy. They were only motivated by money. Only to then have to wait over two hours with a 4 year old who just had a hand crushing injury. Nothing was urgent for them and they don’t rank the cases accordingly. Nobody comes to check you during the time to make sure you’re okay. Waiting and waiting to see the doctor finally saw the doctor only for him to say ok just do an X-ray to be safe. Go to do the X-ray had to wait another half hour because they can’t find the name in the system. Meanwhile my daughter’s hand is throbbing with pain. Everyone who came after us was going in. Got it done finally and go back, then he says nothing looks wrong, just manage the swelling and give Advil for the pain, bye. That was it. This is 1st world health care apparently. What a joke. Sent 5 emails to account department to see if the bill can be negotiated but no response. A woman with an attitude called today and said “well there is nothing we can do about this bill, you came to a country without insurance but you are liable to pay and they would have told you that when you came through triage”. After some back and forth I said ma'am please forward my request to management for them to determine if there is any consideration. So waiting to see what is the verdict. Crazy how these people have zero people skills whatsoever!!! So much for equality- do people from out of country receive some sort of top notch or special service to warrant financial extortion? What is the value for money??? There was zero because I actually got up to leave since they were taking so long to see her and the woman was like it doesn’t matter if you leave as you will still be responsible for all the charges so you might as well stay!!!!

Update- there is no reduction in the cost for providing worst than 3rd world care. $1000+ just to walk in and walk out. I must say though that the paramedics were the best and they were worth their fee. They took her vitals and stayed with her throughout the time they were with us.

I declined the vitamin K injection and the pediatrician came by multiple times to try to convince me to inject my child with this synthetic vitamin (the risk of which to my child's future fertility or cancer rates is not known, according to the data he gave me). P.S. my baby was pricked multiple times for blood tests and clotted up just fine! Do your research before birth!

It seems that the nurses and doctors here have no idea what to do with a women who does not take the epidural. I showed up 9cm dilated and they were asking me questions DURING MY CONTRACTIONS. I was PARCHED and they would not give me water until my child's father spoke up for me. When I wanted to move they were uncomfortable. They pressured me to do things I was not comfortable with (getting an IV placed in my arm). Saying no once should be enough. I understand this is standard medical procedure for birthing in a hospital but my rights to say no were continuously ignored while I was in my most vulnerable state.

I wanted to give birth squatting over the bed to use gravity and to avoid unnecessary pressure on my pelvic muscles but the OB, Dr. Olufunto Laseinde, was not okay with this. She tried to forced me to give birth in the least optimal position, lying on my back. I'm really glad I did research during my pregnancy. I lied on my side as it is a better position for the pelvis and the baby and would not birth on my back and eventually the nurse talked the doc into ""letting me"" birth this way.

The nurses loved to fear monger. They are not used to a woman who is educated in physiological birth. Due to the stress my labour contractions slowed down a bit, which caused one of the nurses to project her fear onto me and started vocalizing that they have to make sure my baby was ok! Like god damn, way to stress out a woman in labour even more!! I wanted to wait for my baby's umbilical cord to stop throbbing before cutting so that my baby received all their placental blood. One nurse was yelling ""The blood is leaving the baby and going back into you!!"" They clearly forgot or didn't learn birth anatomy and physiology in school. Giving birth here was an embarrassment and I truly regret ever stepping foot here.

To all the mothers considering birthing here, please please your research into physiological birth. They push so many things here that disrupt the bonding between mother and child. And they try so hard to push unnecessary interventions before and after birth.

Once again, if you plan on having an unmedicated birth do not come here and quite frankly try to avoid any hospital. There is a lovely birthing center in Toronto or go for a homebirth.

P.S. I had one nurse during my stay here that was so lovely and treated me like a human despite not agreeing with my beliefs. I believe her name was Kathleen. Thank you so much you really lifted my spirits after having one hell of a night.

P.P.S. I did end up delivering unmedicated <3 despite all the cards stacked against me.

On june 5th My water broke, i was in excruciating pain and was already 6cm dilated, one of the nurses- this young girl was visibly frustrated with me i asked her for an epidural she told me the anesthesiologist is in a C-section & i need to calm down cause he isnt leaving to come give me an epidural… then she told her colleague “i have 3 patients already i cant handle this” (meaning me ). One of the other nurses asked why i was there if i was scheduled for an induction at humber river(when the ambulance brought me cause i wouldmt have made it to humber)… and then the young nurse who was already being rude  said “we were already having a hectic morning but then bianca wanted to show up” i responded i wish i was at humber river she replied back with “girl we wish you were at humber river too.” There were many other distasteful comments said and just her whole demeanour as if i was an inconvenience to be there.. i think shes in the wrong career. Why be a nurse if you dont have compassion and its so difficult /frustrating for you to take care of ur patients? Then when i get home a day later the hospital is calling me for my baby’s name ? But we handed in the paperwork so im confused why they wouldnt have my baby’s name …overall my experience was not the greatest at this hospital and i wouldnt want to deliver here again…"

""I will give you something that should provide relief in 1-2 days. And if not I will give you a reference to a practice downtown, it is a bit of driving but it's good"". I got the referral and the prescription. When I reached my pharmacy, the pharmacist showed me the differences in medication - ER doc got the same thing, less dosage (10 mg instead of 20 mg), over the counter medication vs. what I got from walk in clinic which was prescription. I put the 1 and 1 together at that time - it was all about the referral. Don't fix it, send the clients to the practice downtown.

My encounter with this hospital on December 27, 2023, unfortunately, unfolded as a deeply traumatic experience, casting a shadow over what should have been a joyous occasion. From the onset, a series of disappointing and distressing events unfolded, leaving an indelible mark on my memory.
As a patient from another hospital, unforeseen circumstances led me to seek assistance here when I went into labour. The pain was intense upon arrival, yet it took nearly three hours before I received any form of medication, exacerbating an already challenging situation.
Regrettably, the conduct of a particular nurse marred the quality of care I received. Her demeanour was far from compassionate; instead, she exhibited rudeness and unkindness, attempting to intimidate and ignore me, and disregard my concerns on multiple occasions. Besides she showed a lack of technical knowledge. Such behaviour from a healthcare professional is unacceptable and deeply troubling.
Despite assurances, the promised lactation consultant was not available. Furthermore, upon discharge, I was left without a prescription for pain management, adding unnecessary distress to an already difficult postpartum period.
Compounding these issues, the hospital retained the medical records I had brought with me from the previous facility, refusing to return them. This lack of cooperation and respect for patient autonomy is deeply concerning and reflective of systemic shortcomings.
While the hospital's infrastructure was commendable, and interactions with other staff members were more positive, the enduring impact of the nurse's conduct overshadowed any positive aspects. This experience has left me profoundly disappointed in the hospital's standards of care and underscores the urgent need for improvements to ensure that no one else has to endure similar trauma, leading me to caution others against choosing this hospital unless absolutely necessary."

I was there three times over the course of a week. First and foremost I am extremely reasonable and understanding of the fact that this is a hospital and our hands are in the safety of these hard working nurses and doctors. With that being said I am extremely worried if the people working here are the future of our medicine. I have never witnessed/been a part of anything like this. To start, I entered the emergency room with not one person in it, still waiting for number to be called and was extremely patient. Among listening to two young female nurses in the registration rooms talk about eyeshadow and other personal things, after 20 minutes of being in obvious pain I decided to interrupt and ask if I was in the right place as she continued to tell me she will be with me in a minute. At this point I realized that this is what I was waiting for.. two people to have a conversation giggiling laughing and conversing at my expense. She then called me in and did my registration and told me to follow he green line in to emerg. As much as at this point I was upset I chalked it up to maybe she was just doing her job and wasn’t allowed to let another patron in yet, and decided to get over it.
I then was eventually called in by a nurse and explained my pain to her, she then proceeded to put IV in my arm. I have received IV many times before and right away as it was entering she says the words “uh-oh”. I asked what was wrong she said I think I got it it’s just so slippy. A phrase I don’t think anyone is comfortable hearing. I told her I was having a burning sensation in my arm and she told me it’s not a and to wait for the doctor to call my name. As I sat there in pain now from my arm I patiently waited for the doctor to call me in. Fast forward, doctor comes in with the wrong information. Asked why I was coming back for chest pain when I was there a week ago with pneumonia .. I told him I was here from abdominal pain and told him I have been sick from the medication prescribed to me. I also mentioned my arm being in pain from the IV and he told me when I go get a CT they will fix it and then told me I may have an infection from the medication.
Went for a CT,
The nurse working there was the only pleasant person I spoke to throughout the night, she freaked out when she saw my arm and said “who did this to you”. I said the nurse in registration and I told her I’ve been in pain from it. She starts freaking out and has to remove it quickly because it was jabbed into no vein and running blood everywhere.. she then re did my IV in my other arm and apologized to me and was ashamed of it. Thank god for her because she told me of some other nurse just injected the saline, I could have lost my arm. There was 100% different things, the most important being the reason why I was back at the hospital was because they gave me two steroids (FOR PNEMONIA) that are not supposed to be taken together and if so can cause ulcers, internal bleeding (IN WHICH I HAD). All in all, It was extremely worrisome to sit there for a total of 16 hours watching such sick people being treated so poorly. A complete lack of empathy, sensitivity and just over all compassion for their surroundings. I don’t think the 85 year old man beside me having heart issues really cared for the two nurses laughing about their weekend and swearing and giggling like children while he was in PAIN. This is not a safe place, it was an overall disgusting experience to the point where I signed an AMA and left the hospital because I would have rather have been in pain then be in the care of these people. I feel bad for the nurses and doctors that work there that actually take their jobs with some dignity and respect that they have to be in the same category as the ones who are clearly so undeserving of a sacred job like that. They should be ashamed, and this was not my first bad experience. I’ve never written a review like his in my life, hopefully it gets in the hands of the right person and they will demand change and growth. You need to do better."

Subject: Concern Regarding Medical Advice and Prescription for a Breastfeeding Patient

I am writing to formally express my concerns about the medical advice and prescription provided to my wife, who was treated at your facility on March 27 2024 for a kidney stone condition.

My wife was in severe pain, and we sought immediate medical attention from your hospital. After being administered pain killer, she was discharged with a prescription for the morphine. However, upon visiting the pharmacy, we were informed that the medication could not be dispensed due to its potential severe respiratory effects on our breastfeeding baby.

This information was contradictory to the assurances given by the attending physician,  who was repeatedly asked about the safety of the medication for a breastfeeding mother and assured us it was safe.

The conflicting information has caused us considerable distress and concern for the well-being of our child. We are troubled by the lack of clear communication and the potential risk posed by the prescribed medication.

We request a thorough investigation into this matter and seek clarification on the hospital’s policies regarding prescribing medication to breastfeeding patients. Additionally, we ask for a written response detailing the findings of your investigation and the steps taken to ensure such an incident does not recur.

We trust that you will treat this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

Masoud Zhian"

My appointment was scheduled for Thursday, Feb 29 and Feb 28 at 3pm I received a call from a woman who worked at the clinic to advise me she was cancelling my appointment and will not been because I don’t meet the criteria. She proceeded to tell me this clinic was for miscarriages only and the ER Dr made a mistake. I was really confused and starting to stress as I just wanted to be seen by an OB that would help me with my complications. The representative was very abrupt and full of attitude. At one point in the conversation she told me there were no Dr’s that worked at the clinic and so I would be turned away and be wasting my time.

Not a call I was expecting less than 24 hours to my appointment. And definitely not the kind of treatment that is remotely acceptable as a representative of a hospital, and considering you’re calling someone who is having complications in her pregnancy and already worried about that. She caused such unnecessary stress and worry and her overall behaviour was absolutely disgusting!

The physical facility is beautiful but that is overshadowed by the blatant ignorance and insufficient services. The nurses would leave my grandmother (who had a stroke and can't not properly take care of herself) ALONE for HOURS. The nurses would ""forget"" to give her the medications that she required for her recovery!  A hospital is not like a retail store where you can get away with ignoring patients, as a lot of people are vulnerable and cannot take care of themselves. The staff were unaware of the various patient's needs and did not seem to care. They were dangerously negligent. During her stay, my grandmother wore a compression sleeve on her arm to reduce swelling and a male nurse put his the full weight of his knee on her sore and STROKE AFFECTED arm in an attempt to savagely pull up the sleeve. How is it ok for a person to put all of their weight on the damaged arm of an old lady - let alone a grown man. This was truly horrifying and as a result, my grandmother is now experiencing heightened and unnecessary pain in her arm. Truly disgusting. If you can, take your loved ones to any other hospital before coming here."

The people working here are extremely « authentic » starting with the cleaning lady, lunch lady, volunteers and to the nurses, social workers, nutritionists, spiritual facilitators and doctors. I’ve interacted with all of them so believe me I know.

Multiple nurses cared for me but the following have really impressed me by doing something special: nurses Boris, Kam, Elena, F and R (using just initials out of respect for privacy).

There are too many stories to tell but I’m just going to focus on the female nurses.

Nurse Elena is the kindest nurse ever, with the best bedside manner ever. She talked to me like I’m a real friend of hers. I remember once she felt offended when I called her just “nurse” and she corrected me saying I should be calling her by her first name. Also she’s the only nurse that I’ve seen who doesn’t hide her last name on her badge - all others put a piece of tape over it or just wear their badge backwards. I recall that her last name starts with V and that it’s a long Russian sounding name that I will never remember.

As for nurse F, there was a situation with a patient who became violent and threatening from a small thing like changing the TV channel. Nurse F took the initiative and talked in private to the patients who were still in the common area (including me) on how to handle ourselves. She was very calm and articulate. I really appreciated that type of response from the staff. One day at the end of her shift I asked her how she plans to get home and looking very tired and with puffy eyes she answered that she plans to drive herself home.
I mean, for real?? You’re telling me the hospital leadership and nurses union cannot negotiate some sort of stipend for public transit and/or Uber taxi etc so that nurses after a 12-hr shift can get home safely?? This would be a non-issue if all nurses could drive Teslas running the latest stable version of FSD Autopilot but that’s just a pipe dream on my part. Even any other car (gas/hybrid/EV) with some version that’s as good as the above software. Anyway that’s just my rant for today..back to the review below.

Nurse R has really impressed me with her speed, hard work and multi-tasking ability. She was also very professional even when I put her in some special shall we say « tricky » situations (lol!). She has by far the most beautiful smile from behind the face mask. Whenever we joke around and she makes eye contact while smiling - her eyes are beaming this warm and fuzzy energy into my soul. What goes through my mind in that moment is
« Oh God, how I wish I could have a co-worker / colleague like that, someone who would motivate me to join that 7 AM Zoom meeting 10 mins early so that we could chit chat about our lives. I better do what I need to do to get better and get outta here ASAP! »

By the way, the word « authentic » that I used above is in the same context or meaning as in the following quote from Dalai Lama:

« Our life depends on others so much that at the root of our existence there is a fundamental need for love. That is why it is good to cultivate an authentic sense of our responsibility and a sincere concern for the welfare of others ».

By now you might think this is the best hospital in the world but you might be wrong. In my excitement as I was leaving (or was it when I was admitted on 18/4, not certain), I asked Nicole, a nurse working in Emergency how much is needed to make Cortellucci hospital the best hospital in the world and she said she would write a number in my chart. I have a feeling it’s greater than $0 but if some benefactor reads this review then perhaps they can  make some contribution..I will also make one from the limited disposable income I have currently. I hear that a School of Medicine will be built here soon. -CGP"

I visit the ER twice this week. Once for my son and once for my husband. My son's visit was okish, long wait very little patients and 3 doctors. Our doctor was great, wish I got his name. horrible nurses.. couldn't direct us.. didn't even acknowledge us. (Except the charge nurses, they were helpful)
My husband (dialysis patient with trouble breathing) nurses from beginning to end were incredible! Helpful and compassionate.
Dr. Fu... Horrendous
Slow, 0 compassion, 0 bedsides manners. If he's the doctor on the night you go to emerge leave and go to another hospital. The nurses even complained about him, people were becoming angry and frustrated from his behaviour. The nurses were trying their best to pick up his slack. I felt so bad for them . Emergency room was full!!! And he could care less.. babies screaming, children vomiting, my husband who is sick and has underlying conditions sat waiting for help from 10- 630 and it was his fault because the nurses took my husband's situation seriously and seen him quickly.in the end he didn't even help him, all he did was give him anxiety and high blood pressure from becoming nervous from his remarks and false  diagnosis probability (what doctor does that) and you couldn't ask him questions.we are grateful for the medicine doctor  and nurses that helped him.

The triage nurse (I believe her name was Sam) was very helpful and efficient, and quickly directed me to get registered in the system and to be seen by ambulatory doctors. Every healthcare professional I met during the visit was friendly. The doctor was super chill and patient in explaining everything that came back from the tests. It took about 3.5 hours in total from walking in to getting all the tests done (ECG, bloodwork, X-Ray) to being discharged from the hospital. Overall, the patient experience was wonderful and it was contrary to the hour-long, messy visits to ER I imagined.

Everything in the facility is also very clean and high quality. No stains anywhere and very quiet. Very pleased with the environment."

I DO NOT recommend anyone to come here especially elderly, people of colour and those in severe pain who need immediate attention. I was in EXCRUCIATING pain due to an enlarged and infected cyst. I was unable to walk due to the pain from the cyst, I asked multiple times for a wheelchair and was NEVER given one. I was forced to walk all over the hospital with NO assistance. The nurses saw me crying and looked the other way. None of the doctors or nurses at this hospital care for their patients. If you don’t want to die do not come here pls. You are better off going to Humber river hospital, faster and better service. I was in the hospital for 3 days at Cortellucci hospital. Every single day they drew 5 large bottles of blood claiming they were doing blood cultures, but in fact I believe they are stealing peoples blood because there was no need for that. I was extremely weak because of this and lack of food and water. The OB even performed the wrong surgery, no follow up after and it’s been 4 months. After the OB performed the wrong surgery they were trying to force us to stay at the hospital under false pretences to correct the error. When we refused and requested to leave they then tried to force us to sign release documents to get out of possible liability and negligence claims because that’s exactly what it was. This hospital should be shut down and the individuals working here should be ashamed of themselves. One of the resident students even told us in confidence that the OB performed the wrong surgery and they are trying to correct it. She felt so bad and kept apologizing to us. Only person I met there with a heart and some sort of compassion."

She said no words during the procedure and act so miserable. As a pregnant mom I am already under stress and the way she acts and that I am not able even to see the baby, gave so much anxiety to me and was crying after the procedure. Also she said in 2 days my doctor will get the results and I was eonder how come I will not get it in “my chart” like other tests.

They left me bleeding after surgery, unattended! They did not patch me up properly. The indian nurses have 0 experience with the type of procedure i had done. They did not know how to treat the wound or stop the bleeding. I was bleeding for half an hour on the bed! On top of that they were about to discharge me! Until my family came and asked for a different nurse and doctor. It took them 3.5 hours to finally treat me and stop the bleeding. The whole time they were giving attitude and telling me that “ they see a lot worst everyday” and that they wouldnt patch me up unless the cleaner comes and cleans the blood off the floor. So they were worried about the blood on the floor instead of worrying about stopping the bleeding!!!! Also dont forget all the chemicals that they were using while i had an open wound. I should have sued!!! Unbelievable! Its my first time going through this and im only 30years old. Never had an issue before. So clearly i was scared and shocked from all the bleeding i saw. Never again! STAY AWAY!

Update august 1st 2024: a bug went in my fathers ear when he was out walking, he went to the hospital to get it washed out or cleaned.. which should have been very quick in and out. They mad him wait hours, when the doctor finally came to see him, he said that he cannot do anything about it because its not his “specialty” and he would have to see a specialist. Young doctor, clearly with 0 experience. Probably still a student. All he had to do was flush it out. My father was in a lot of pain because it was deep inside his ear and it was effecting his hearing. We took him to humber hospital on the same day, they flushed it out in literally 5 minutes!

1) A short Phillipino nurse who was very nosey asking about where's the husband or boyfriend and talking and in the presence of the young lady discussing with another person that she should not get pregnant at a young age. How does she expect the teenage mom who was at her mercy in the labour to feel about her comment?
Also, this nurse had me working as though I was a staffasking for to to assist with repositioning the young lady whom at  this point was administered the epidural and this repositioning is done often. I injured my back doing this now I am off work and taking physiotherapy for a pulled muscle. She's trained for this not me. Anyways I told her she should have someone from her team to assist her with the repositioning and placing the peanut thingy she rudely told it's my job to assist her that is why I am there , and the other nurses has to attend to other birthing moms.
After the birth the said Philippino nurse was very harsh with new mom by ripping the tape off her skin  as if the new mom was an animal even though she was screaming that it hurts. She replied "" this is the only way to get it off"".
After giving birth the said nurse told me to go to Tim Horton's to get the new mom something to eat and drink to prevent the new mom from fainting when she escorts her to the washroom because they are out of stock on the unit. I take it that out of stock meant no cookies or juice in the Kitchen Pantry. ( what If I wasn't there with the new mom would  she just pass out)?
I ask for a personal belongings bag and was told they are out of stock and was  handed  large light blue garage bag.
On the D wing  where mom and baby was recovering some of the nurses treatment this teenage mom very badly  by talking down to her and didn't make any attempt to bath the baby after 24 hours neither did they assist the new mom with anything even though she needed help at times. One nurse yelled at her telling her that she's wasting the free formula they gave her even though they were informed that the baby was not sucking hence why the baby was being monitored closely  for this by the pediatrician. ( therefore mom had to throw away the open bottle of formula after a certain time).

I work at a hospital setting and communicate with physicians on a daily basis; I have encountered dismissive physicians, but dismissive physician towards a PATIENT? Don't think that reflects your hospital vision and goals much?
How am I supposed to have "" world class health experience"", if I face dismissive doctors and nurse who doesn't know basic drugs (mode of action/side effects), basic, I'm talking ibuprofen and ketorolac, acetaminophen?

Physician spent less than 25 seconds in the assessment room (i am not making this up) he asked me 3 questions, he didn't let me answer any of those 3 questions, interupting when i only said one word, proceeds to percuss one side of my back,  i scream in pain, throws "" will do a CT, see you in 5 hr"", and leaves the room.
What a subpar inadequate initial assessment by a er doc: percussed one side, didn't check/palpate/ascultate anything else, didn't collect any subjective info since *he didn't let me answer any of his questions*. Is this a standard of patient assessment in this hospital? Or flank pain doesn't appear ""serious"" enough for an ER doc and its ok to dismiss patients assessment like that? What if there was a more serious case and a patient can't advocate for themselves like I can? You also perform ""25 seconds 10% completed assessments""?that's why I wouldn't bring a loved one here, if someone is not there to advocate, they will receive inadequate care.

Later accessed my chart online. I read "" abdomen is soft"". Sir, you didn't touch my abdomen. You documenting parts of the assessment that never happened? is that a common practice to chart something you didn't perform?

1 hr later he calls me to tell me ""I don't know what's wrong with you, tests are fine, is ur pain better?"", I say yes, it went from 7 to 5 because ..he again interupts, goes OH great! May be your stone passed (stone? thats new since diagnosis of ""stone"" was never considered +i dont fit criteria, was never discussed/mentioned by doc). I say ""no, I got ketorolac push and that's why pain went down"".💀 He would know it, if he looked at the chart. Randomly throwing diagnosis without anything supporting it?

Since I was still in severe pain , I ask the doc, what does that mean? I am still in severe pain, what should I do next? What tests would benefit? Should I see another doctor? I need to go to work and I am in so much pain now?

The doctor hands me a prescription for percocets and throws ""wellllll nooo you cant work then, if u spike a fever, come back, thanks for coming to this hospital"".

Excuse me, are you not the health care provider? I get it, you ruled out an emergency, ur pt is still in severe pain, so you just throw a perc prescription and "" thanks for coming this this hospital"", which sounds extremely sarcastic as I am still asking for your care. Doc goes "" you need an US for the ovarian cyst"". Did you not look at my chart to see my chronic PMH that would explain the cyst? I guess checking patient's chart is not a common practice?
I tell the doc, the cyst doesn't bother me, it's the severe kidney pain that I am still experiencing, and for the third and last time he throws "" that's why i give you percocets, thank you for coming to this hospital"".

I am blown away by this dismissive care, inadequate assessments and the need to kick patient out by saying this ""thanks for coming to this hospital"" at the most inappropriate times? May be less fake politeness and more decent patient care and adequate assessments?
You would think staff has hair up for safe practice and professional look..The nurse in ER ensured to have beautiful long curled hair hanging over the IV as she was inserting, but refused to give me ketorolac bc"" it has Tylenol in it"" . Then proceeds to offer me advil for possible kidney condition  (which u never do bc ibuprogen gets excreted through kidneys) At this point, just google the meds you administer most frequently and memorize them
Ended up going to a different ER where doctor didn't dismiss me or my case."

The hospital is clean, really well organized, and quite quick. The staff are kind. There are colour coded lines on the wall which make this hospital really easy to navigate, which I highly commend.

There are four things that were significantly concerning to me, however.

1) The doctor (a man, Dr. Bajwa) didn’t ask me what medications I take for some reason, despite prescribing me medication. This hospital does not have record of my medications. They also didn’t ask anything about my medical history and did not look into my mouth or throat despite my problem being related to that. I thought this was a little irresponsible.

2) I needed chest x-rays, and they were completed incorrectly by the hospital technician, so the doctor could not use the results. This was stressful for me. The x-ray could not be repeated due to radiation exposure.

3) I got a viral panel and the Dr. told me I’d get a call letting me know the results in one day. I never got a call, and the prescription depended on me getting the results. So I essentially got no proper care or advice.

4) The cost of parking is astronomical. I was there for 1.5 hours and had to pay $17 for parking. I was shocked by that."

Once we got to the doctor he was very dismissive, he kept talking over us when we tried to explain what was going on, gave us some history lesson on why we have wisdom teeth and dismissed my partners infection as wisdom tooth pain. He then gave us an anti-inflammatory. When we tried to ask about the fact that the nurses also saw discharge he told us to tell the nurses no that he determined it's not infection when he hadn't listened to us nor run any tests. We then had to go to another doctor after wasting 4 hours of our time at the hospital in order to get the antibiotics my partner needed."

I had the most incredible experience delivering my baby at this hospital (shout to Lauren and Dr.Laseinde as well as the whole nursing team). The facilities are so clean and the staff is so friendly and supportive. We were there for 24 hours in beautiful rooms. The nurses were so attentive and provided me a peanut ball, regular yoga hall and other tools to deliver in the best way possible. The birthing area is so lovely, the decor does not make you feel like you’re in some dreary hospital but revives you.

In my opinion this is the best hospital to give birth in! Highly recommended. Also another shout out to my OB, Dr. Sisca"

Literally the worse, she's rude and literally had my mom sitting in a soiled diaper for over an hour and was informed multiple times within that hour that she still has not come and changed my mom.  She kept saying she's busy but I could clearly hear here engaging in casual conversation at the desk right outside the room but anytime I would remind her that she still has not changed my mom yet , she miraculously had something to do and would walk away. If she doesn't want to do her job then she needs to reconsider her field. Unacceptable.

Joseph who was covering for Maria/Melissa when she magically disappeared again tried changing my mom by himself and I told him my mom couldn't move because she was in too much pain and also had a chest tube in, connected to an oxygen machine, so on and so forth.

We had some good nurses during our stay but this one is no good"

I had an overall positive experience with the treatment, exams, ultrasounds, and the ER doctor.

I took one star off because of a bad experience with one of the nurses that drew blood from me - it was terribly painful, I literally screamed in pain. She didn’t know what she was doing, dripped my blood on the floor, a disaster and very non-hygienic (I didn’t see it be clean). She poked me with the needle in 3 different places and couldn’t draw my blood until I asked to please get someone else to do it. Both my arms were sore and bruised for a week afterwards.

Anyway, besides that the hospital staff was nice, great facility, genuine caring doctor."

After getting the X-ray done, they didn’t even meet us to explain what was causing the pain. We only knew the diagnosis (knee sprain) after the nurse printed the prescription for painkillers and ask us to go to a follow up clinic 10 days later.

We came home without resolving any worries in our mind. How can a bony bump that is so visible on the knee just a sprain? If it is, it would be nice to actually have someone to let know in-person instead if printing a piece of paper and ask us to log into the online portal and figure it out ourselves.
