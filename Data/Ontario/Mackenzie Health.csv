Despite arriving with a severe and painful eye infection, I waited over three hours before seeing a doctor. The emergency department was severely understaffed, the entire night, leading to delays and inadequate care.

The staff’s behavior was rude and dismissive—when I asked a nurse for pain relief, I was ignored multiple times and even shouted at. The examination area was also unhygienic, with overflowing garbage touching medical equipment. I had to request cleaning before being examined.

When the doctor finally saw me, the consultation lasted less than two minutes, leaving me with unanswered questions and unresolved concerns. Overall, the experience highlighted serious issues with understaffing, professionalism, and hygiene that need immediate attention."

We were in pre admission for a surgery that we have waited 2 plus years for. The whole hospital staff from allowing us to be able register so we don't have to come back as we live in another part of province to the doctors and nurses every single person we interact with was so professional and caring. I can't praise this hospital enough.

I attended on a holiday when urgent care clinics are practically nonexistent in Ontario.  The triage process was fast. My minor urgent injury was addressed very quickly.  The doctor was pleasant and the nurse was friendly with a sense of humor. It was worth the drive to Richmond Hill from Midtown Toronto to avoid the hours long wait downtown.

They have a doctor that works in the emergency wing by the name of DR. HA - who was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional. My partner woke up this morning feeling extremely unwell and was vomiting nonstop. We came into emergency hoping to get some answers considering this isn’t the first time he randomly feels sick to the point of throwing up uncontrollably. The service/treatment we were receiving was great up until we were assigned to Dr. Ha. Upon approaching my helpless partner, he was extremely aggressive and didn’t have a sincere tone when asking the few questions he asked to gain insight. When I recommended my partner getting an ultrasound or perhaps a CT, he was very arrogant and quite belligerent in his response to me, as he felt that extent of testing was unnecessary. If you don’t have genuine care and compassion for ALL people, don’t become a doctor. It’s as simple as that! I will definitely NOT be back. This particular institution needs to do better in terms of training their staff to have empathy and compassion. The future of the healthcare system is quite frightening knowing there are doctors like Dr. Ha who are simply there for the cheque."

The palliative care area was peaceful. However, my dad was in the hospital for a month and no one, no nurses or doctors ordered an airbed for my dad as he could not move. Hence he got a painful bedsore to add to the pain and suffering of congestive heart failure. Neither did they teach my family to move him around so he won’t get bedsores. I would think this is a big concern for immobile patients. Through talking to a friend, I found out about airbeds and proceeded to ask for one. They said they don’t have one. Thankfully, my sister in law who works in the pharmacy department was visiting my dad and she asked for us. We finally got the airbed but lo and behold, I just realized they never turned it on! My dad passed away in February of this year. I just realized it because it didn’t make any sounds. But at the time, I didn’t know that as I assumed the people who provided the bed would turn it on! I’m writing this for those who are inexperienced with long hospital stays, please ask for an airbed, be sure it’s turned on  and move your loved ones around. Also make sure they are sleeping on the right end of the bed. God have mercy on us."

Last week, l had a major surgery at Mount Sainai hospital- such a great place- and was in hospital for 5 days. After 3 days, on Monday, my leg was severely swollen. My surgeon asked me to go to the emergency to do an ultrasound. They worried about blood clots.
My visit turned into a nightmare!!! We arrived around 1:30 PM, but it took nearly 7 hours just to be seen by the doctor and hear the consultation. For me, with a painful abdomen and hip it was impossible to sit more than 10-15 minutes. There was nothing to lie down on, or a recliner. Chairs were uncomfortable, and I was in excruciating pain crying the entire 7 hours of wait. When I requested the nurse a bed to lie down, they let me to rest 10-15 minutes but asked me to leave soon after. The nurse dismissed my plea, stating everyone was in pain. I explained my recent surgery and showed my stitches,  but my pain was treated with indifference. They didn’t even offer anything to reduce the pain.
I was placed in a room filled with patients, which heightened my anxiety about catching another illness. To make matters worse, a nurse rudely scolded me for not being in the right spot.
This experience was not only frustrating but also deeply inhumane. I left feeling ignored and emotionally drained. I hope improvements are made for future patients.
All l can say is they just make sure to follow the protocols to be safe from being sued, but to work in the healthcare system, you need to be sympathetic too!!!"

I had the worst experience ever in an emergency room at Major Mackenzie Hospital. There was only one doctor attending to everyone, which led to long waits and poor care. My patient was in no condition to sit, yet they didn’t even offer a bed, despite the obvious need.

When I politely asked the staff about our turn and the test results, the supervisor responded rudely, basically telling me to just wait. I had heard about the negative reputation of this hospital before, but seeing it firsthand was truly shocking.

I wouldn’t recommend this emergency room to anyone. I hope they make serious improvements in the future."

The staff here are super helpful, there was a period of time during COVID that the patient cannot bring a plus one. I usually translate for my mom as she doesn’t speak English so that worried us a bit. After the staff were made aware, they found a volunteer that specifically spoke her language. I really appreciate the effort as my mom tends to get anxious during body scans and doctor appointments.

The hospital is extremely clean and there are colour-coordinated stickers everywhere to guide you to the correct department. It’s almost impossible to get lost because everything is so easy to understand/follow.

Today’s appointment was a breeze, my mom had two appointments and the two nurses who brought us in were quick on their feet. 40 minutes tops and we were done! They didn’t want us to linger in the hospital too long which I totally understand given the pandemic situation."

I was there from 6 PM to midnight in severe pain, and the service was absolutely appalling. The hospital was clearly understaffed, and the staff’s attitude was shockingly rude. At one point, I expressed my frustration about the poor service and the fact that I needed urgent help, only for a staff member named Remsha in the emergency room to roll her eyes at me, showing a complete lack of empathy.

An unusual incident also occurred when I unknowingly took a photo while Remsha was scrolling on her phone. A person with me informed me it wasn’t allowed, so I deleted it immediately. However, upon seeing this, Remsha became so panicked that she called in security. To my surprise, four security guards arrived within a minute, yet I had been waiting for hours without seeing a single doctor or nurse. The hospital seemed to have more security than medical staff, which is disturbing in an emergency setting.

This level of unprofessionalism, combined with the lack of care, was shocking and deeply frustrating. I would strongly urge anyone to avoid this hospital if they’re looking for even the slightest bit of compassion or respect."

Friendly staff and the tech made the long wait times more bearable.  Seeing the status of a loved one helped to make the time go by faster and knowing that they were actually moving through the process was comforting.  Hopefully this system is or will be deployed across more hospitals in Canada.  Overall a good experience. Would hate to think what the wait times would be without this technology.

If there is a possibility you can call hospitals and EDs to see which one has a shorter wait time.

It was overall a good experience. In one occasion after being seen ij the xray room I was told to go and wait in the patient care/treatment area. While I was waiting someone approached and asked me who I am waiting for. I explained and she guided me to the next door to be seen by the doctor. The other staff came looked frustrated. I never saw or spoke with her before, but she impatiently asked me that why I am sitting there etc. and that I had to get back and sit in another area.

Apart from this happening in which I felt there was a lack of proper communication between the care team, Everything else went surprisingly smooth and created a sense of comfort to the point that I recommended Mackenzihealth to other friends.

Chad Wu is a very trustworthy surgeon I got surgery today. He listened to all my concerns and made me feel comfortable( 5 stars for him)

1 star for the hand physio hand therapist that made my cast on June 19th. She poorly made it and it hurt my hand a lot so I didn’t wear it. On top of that I had an infection which she poorly miss diagnosed , poorly brought to attention which worsened my infection and poorly treated it. Luckily I had enough brain to order a nurse to my house Thursday night that rebandaged it for 3 days straight curing my infection.

Emergency section was a joke. A doctor working night shift on June 19th 3am. Accused me of selling the pain killers I was prescribed. Meanwhile I ubered to the hospital and back home twice a day from horrible pulsating infection pain. Ubers costed me $300. While the pain killers are worth way less. Just a joke this hospital.

On my last visit they didnt even take me serious. They made me over wait on purpose, took patience that checked in after me. I had to uber to a different hospital that took me more serious and right away. All i wanted was a Tordal injection… Also who puts a blood pressure pump on the same arm as stitches… i felt like my hand was about to burst from the pressure… just horrible here. Im very dissapionted. I always came and i was so nice to everyone but i guess being nice at this hospital GETS YOU NO WHERE. Dont be nice to any nurse or doctor or register here.

I understand that hospitals are understaffed and that this is a stressful environment, but you have a duty to treat your patients and their family with care and respect.  Being with my grandfather for a day at this hospital was a deeply frustrating experience.  3 days in we still have no idea whether he’ll have a room, when he’ll get his imaging or when he can be discharged.  I don’t know if this is a MH specific problem or whether this is just indicative of Ontario Healthcare at large.  Either way, this was a deeply disappointing experience and effort to change has to be pursued."

Is free healthcare worth the hassle they put you through??? Are the thousands of bad 1 star reviews throughout the entire existence of this hospital not enough? It truly seems that they have no motion to fix any issues, why would they? PEOPLE NEED THE HOSPITAL AND HEALTHCARE, so they exploit the fact that healthcare is free and hire, SLOW AND RUDE people.

Dr. Stasiak is the most unprofessional poorly trained physician I've ever had the displeasure to be treated by. He runs an equally incompetent staff. I came in for an iv after vomiting extensively and not drinking for 24 hours and having a history of psychosis when triggered. Was not seen for three hours even for so much as an iv because I am under 18 and dr stasiak was the only one who could order the iv. that didn't stop him from waiting until I was wretching in a room having a panic attack and bawling my eyes out. he heard my distress and sent two nurses in who promptly yelled in my face to ""stop breathing like that"" and would not leave when I told them they were further distressing me. I asked for anxiety medication which i am prescribed at home but I was told to receive any type of treatment I would have to see the doctor who was listening to me cry through the curtain writing a report for 40 minutes while my grandpa begged him to treat me, for my dehydration or my panic attack. he finally walked in and I begged for an iv and antinausea medication. he went sure. was that so hard. you didn't have to disrupt everything. I told him i was hyperventilating because of a panic attack after being refused treatment for three hours in a discriminatory fashion because of my age he dismissed me saying he's seen hundreds and that's no excuse and started raising his voice at me and moving into my space. i felt very uncomfortable and when I said so he refused to leave and kept berating me until we could get my mom on the phone. when he was informed of my medical history he made no previous effort to even peer at i was given an atavin with urgency. after being violated by  three ""medical professionals "" i was inconsolable and on the verge of passing out from dehydration and hyperventilation. Dr Philip stasiak is the bad doctor one hears about in the media. someone so untrained with a bed side manner that borders on abusive and hostile. if Mackenzie health wishes to maintain their integrity as a hospital and trauma center they should fire dr Joe stasiak immediately and replace him with someone with adequate mental health training that doesn't send nurses in to yell at patients he's too good to treat. in an ideal world his license would be taken away."

The nurses especially work hard, during this pandemic.  They work double shifts and always ready to help. But, citizens,  what is happening? You must listen to instructions from our leader, scientists and doctors.  SURE we live in a free and free speech country.  Personally I would like to continue.  Our current Prime Minister 's father in the late 60's invoked martial law, during the FLQ crisis. It's not fun having to pass military check points. Wear your masks when out and don't leave your bubbles. MacKenzie Health is at capacity, as is every hospital in Canada.  Get your vaccine ASAP , here they can't stress it enough.  Then very soon we will beat this Covid and it's variables. Everyone who works here could use a break. Then once Canada beats this,  these workers are ready to go to much less fortunate countries and help the world become healthy. The dedication I see here is unbelievable.  I was sceptical too about the vaccine, not anymore.  As soon as I can I will get it.  So if you don't want military in the streets. Do what you need to do.  Then Canada will be first.  This hospital is proof as are all our hospitals.  Don't think about your little discomforts now, think about our future generations children.
Be careful and stay safe."

The nurses were highly skilled and attentive to my mom's medical needs and took the time to explain the procedure, ensuring we felt informed and at ease. A big thank you goes to Irina A., the nurse who attended to my mom in the recovery room. Her kind and compassionate approach truly made a difference in my mom's overall experience. She made sure she was comfortable and constantly checked on her to ensure she had everything she needed.

The communication before and after the procedure was truly commendable. Dr. Cheung, the anesthesiologist, took the time to explain her role and answered all our questions patiently and in detail. Dr. Cohen Lyons who performed the endoscopy/colonoscopy described the procedure and listened carefully to our concerns. We never felt rushed in any of our interactions with both doctors. It was clear that they are not only skilled at their job, but genuinely care about the well-being of the patients. This made my mom feel respected and valued as an individual, not just a medical case.

The positive and supportive atmosphere created by the members of this department cannot be overstated. The entire staff, from the front desk staff, to the doctors and nurses, exuded professionalism and kindness. It's clear that the department prioritizes patient well-being in every aspect of their operations.

Our recent visit was an incredibly positive experience. The exceptional medical care, compassionate staff, clean and inviting environment, and effective communication truly set this department apart. My mom and I are deeply grateful for the great care she received and wouldn't hesitate to recommend dr. Cohen-Lyons and his entire staff to anyone in need of top-quality healthcare with a personal touch.
Thank you."

Although the wait is still long they move you along to different areas and you get some entertainment from the staff in between meaning they are joyful with patients. But today there was some confusion happening between the doctor and the nurse who comes in to tell you what to do next. 4 times they screwed up mainly because of communication between them. My poor dad was told to undress, dress, undress, get on the bed, get back in the chair, he gets to leave, he's going for a scan etc etc they weren't sure what they were doing but that's ok it seemed a bit busy. Their demeanor made up for it and he went home with good results. Thank you to Mackenzie Health Emergency"

It’s never easy when you go to the emergency department, especially when it’s for your kid who you’re worried about. I think people have unreasonable expectations when they go to the ED.

After having an absolutely horrid experience at the ED at Cortelluci Vaughan, we came here. My son was experiencing serious issues and they prioritized us, immediately gave us the treatments and tests we needed. Most of the nurses were really amazing (a couple grumpy ones, but that’s not even that bad). My son left with a clean bill of health, a helpful prescription, and an improved state.

I am forever grateful to the nurses who tended to us. It wasn’t easy but one nurse in particular whose name I never learned made it almost fun in a way! Spectacular attitude for someone working such a stressful job. They did everything they needed to do, they explained things step by step, and they were gentle with my son.

I had 4 family members that were admitted in the past and the experience was either poor or very poor.  If you want good doctors, go to hospitals downtown.  I didn't want to believe this but based on my past experience, the above statement is generally true.  Recently my sibling was admitted due to abdominal/back pain on a Friday.  She was not given any food for 2 days in case they need to perform surgery on her pending an MRI scan.  She waited the entire weekend without doing the MRI and was finally given food on Sunday.  The level or care and communications is truly lacking.

As she speaks limited English, she (and we) asked for an Activation Code for 'mychart' so that we can sign up online to review her results and communicate it to her in our native tongue so that she can make an informed decision.  After 3 days of asking various nurses and at least 1 doctor, we were either ignored, given the attitude, got the run around, or was eventually provided the wrong code by a nurse that was trying to help.  It was like pulling teeth.  It got me thinking that 'the code' was some top secret and we were not suppose to know it.  Does anyone in the hospital know how to retrieve this code from the EPIC Systems?

Without going into details and long story short, the diagnostic was inconclusive after various scans (which I can understand due to various factors).  Her pain also subsided during the hospital stay.  She was informed by the doctor that they recommended surgery as a preventative measure.  We eventually did not take the recommendation based on the poor communication, overall poor experience, and more importantly, the inability to access test results in order to make an informed decision.

We finally got the activation code for mychart on the day of discharge.  It was printed on the discharge paper.   We finally could access test results when this information was least helpful ...after everything was said and done..."

Never go to this one if you care about your health and treatment. My mom and another old lady were screaming from pain but the doctor was busy by discharging patients that could walk and talk themselves.😐 They didn't even have enough bed for two patients that needed to rest from pain."

At first the radiology department messed up my imaging report and claim that my 20cm mass is only 2.0cm. Then I was referred for an urgent MRI here and the scheduling office called me to schedule one 4 months later. Called their scheduling center to follow up and they indicated that in my OB’s requisition it did say “ASAP”, yet their radiologist still marked my potential cancer case as non-urgent. I followed up several times the following day and they simply said they haven't received a response from the radiologist. They insisted I get my OB to call the radiologist to change the priority but refused to give me the contact information for the radiologist for me to pass to my OB. Further, given how busy my OB is, I highly doubted she would be able to just sit by on hold to reach their radiologist. I was extremely frustrated by these instances.

The scheduling center subsequently followed up with me and ended up scheduling an urgent MRI for me. I am not sure if it was due to my OB's office reaching out to them or that the radiologist has reviewed and decided to change the priority. The MRI itself was a simple process for me and the technician was timely for the appointment. The technician was friendly and I had a positive experience doing the MRI scan.

My MRI result came out in two days after I did the MRI, which is timely. I noticed that Mackenzie Health also fixed my erroneous imaging report and updated my records. Given that they have actioned swiftly to ensure I get the right level of care for my case and to remediate their previous error, I am updating my rating to 4 stars.

I appreciate that Mackenzie Health's patient relations has responded to my review. I have no outstanding feedback at the moment."

Her voice is disturbing, especially in the waiting area were is filled with patients at mid-night.

From the moment of entering the ER, the staff will make you feel you are “annoying” them. They will give you thousands of legitimate reasons why you need to wait for your turn for hours even you are in severe pain (later diagnosed as caused by kidney stone). They don’t see it or they have seen it too much, so they don’t care. If you raise concern, you will be warned they would call Security. Funny enough was only 2 nurses  were taking care of about 15 patients and you wait long time for the pain IV medication, but 4 securities showed up within a minute when you reported the patient could not stand the pain and requested a doctor to see him. Seeing you loved one sweating, vomiting and groaning from pain for 5 hours despite of increased dose of Tylenol, Morphine, and hyper morphine, then you were told the patient needs to wait till next Morning (12 hours later) to see the specialist to decide the treatment, would you feel desperate? I did. When I begged the ER doctor to request a visit of the specialist on call that night, I was told the case was not urgent enough. Because of the scene I made, the manager on call showed up with 4 securities, separating me from the patient. Then I was told the patient had agreed to wait till next morning. If I make any more noises, I would be escorted out of the hospital by security. The fact was the patient was so week at the point that he even could not talk, later he shared that he was offered a ward bed and he said yes because he wanted so much to lie down. The interaction with the securities were terrible, they were rude and forceful.
In the 7 hours at the ER, I observed and experienced the word “inhumane” at a place humane spirit should guide. I don’t think it is one or two staff that lack of professionalism, but this hospital has fundamental problems in terms of operations, management and training. If you expect reasonable attention, timely treatment and compassionate care, this ER is not your choice.
P.S: the patient was seen by a specialist next morning and an operation was immediately performed. The specialist was very professional and capable. The change from 1 star to 2 stars was to appreciate the doctor and nurses’s great work at the ward and operation room!"

As part of the process an intubation tube was inserted into my mouth.  I was asleep for the entire procedure.  When I woke up I discovered I had a broken front tooth .  This trauma to my mouth occurred during the anaesthetization. My upper gum was swelling and another tooth beside the broken one was fractured. While I was recovering, two doctors and a nurse approached me and apologized for the incident. Because I was in recovery I didn't get a chance to take it more seriously.
I contacted the hospital after I came home and wanted to talk to the doctor.  It took a long time for him to respond to me through the patient relation department. His first response was he had no idea what happened and indicated I was fine when I left the surgery room. Later on I noticed in my chart he documented I had signed a waiver regarding injury to temporary crowns and dentures. I didn't think the waiver applied to my dental work.  Following that I went to my dentist who outlined a lengthy, extensive, and expensive procedure to repair my teeth.
When I looked at the official hospital report, it was stated by a nurse that I had told her my tooth was broken and that the doctor was contacted, but nothing more.
This hospital didn’t want to take any responsibility and the doctor lied on the report about me not telling them I had a loose tooth. My teeth were fine before the surgery as recent dental x-rays would indicate.  The doctor suggested that either my teeth were damaged prior to surgery (nothing mentioned in the report) or somehow my teeth were damaged in the recovery room.
This terrible incident bought me huge negative impact on my recovery and my self esteem and daily life. I can't eat properly, I don't want to see people, I'm embarrassed to even smile at my son.  I don't want to return to work as I don't wish to have anyone see my mouth.
I only want the hospital, specifically the doctor to acknowledge that it was their fault that my teeth got broken.  And I would like them to pay for the dental work, as it is very expensive and will only be covered by my insurance after the entire procedure is complete."

The ER doctor told me that I would have to get an ultra sound just to be sure that it was my appendix. The guy who did my ultra sound was great, but apparently the shots weren't good enough.

Back to the ER where I was told I needed a cat scan.

After the cat scan, they confirmed it was my appendix and they I would need surgery. The doctor told me they would give me some antibiotics and that I would get surgery by 6:30AM the next day. They even told me that there was a good chance they would rupture. WHAT? And I have to wait?

The headless nurse came to give me the antibiotics but got distracted and I had to remind her to do it several times before she finally did.

They told me I would be waiting in the ER till a room was ready. It was almost 1AM at this point and I was exhausted and starving and dehydrated because I was told I couldn't eat or drink.

They put me on a stretcher in the hallway to sleep all night. Headless nurse told me that I wouldn't be admitted for surgery until I had a room.

I forced myself up and went to complain to some other nurses who laughed at me and told me I was hallucinating due to morphine. I tried to tell them that's what the ER nurse told me but they didn't care. So I went back to my corner and cried.

Another nurse approached me and said there was no documentation to prove that the ER doctor told my family and I that I would be having surgery by then.

I was finally admitted into a room where I had to wait until 4PM before I had surgery.

When I woke up from surgery, I was in massive amounts of pain and I was not given a Popsicle/freezie like I was given in other hospitals. I was told having anything would make me sick.

I was dehydrated because they had barely given me any fluids through my IV (I had only been through two bags in two whole days) and I hadn't had anything to drink since 11:30AM the day before.

My recovery period after surgery, wasn't too awful and the doctors who did my surgery were okay. Everything else was a terrible experience."

I had a hard attack recently and received a stent in one of my arteries. After being released from St. Michael hospital and staying a little at home, I felt some sort of discomfort feeling this morning and was taken by an ambulance to ER of Major Mackenzie hospital. After initial checking and ECG, they asked me to sit on one of the chair within waiting corridor. As I was sitting for a while I felt discomfort and the chair was also uncomfortable, so I asked for somebody's help. A lady appeared and told me a nurse could help me in another section and I can walk there. So, I told her I couldn't walk and asked her to a wheelchair or something to take me to that room. Over there it was very cold and I asked multiple time to ""please give me a blanket"" and finally a nurse did. A nurse also showed up and told me she would take blood work. It seemed like she wasn't able to properly complete the blood work (seemed she was not trained properly or was a beginner) and while the syringe had been inserted into my hand's vein, she asked another nurse to help her finding another vein. Another nurse showed up and did blood work and it was so painful that I forgot the pain of heart issue. Several big bruises remained on my hand. In total, when I compare the way that the nurses treated me in St. Michael Hospital, I would say that they were behaving much more friendly and cooperative and the environment over there was way better."

Went by herself. While she was getting blood work, the nurse and her did not realized the chair has blood on it. My gf sat down and her white pant was blood all over . She freaked out and yelled at the nurse . She said she caused a scene. And when she left with the doctor prescription the doctor didn’t even tell her to remove the needed out of her arm. She walked half way out . Like seriously!!!’???? She’s not coming back ever!"

The staff in the ER were good, and the nurses were nice and caring. However, as soon as I was moved to the regular room everything changed. This male nurse named Michael (Mike) was rude, inconsiderate, and without empathy. During one of the mornings in the hospital, I asked for Tylenol and Gravol in the morning. I was receiving these medications regularly in the morning for the severe headache and dizziness I was experiencing while I was in ER for two days. However, when I asked for my medication this morning, Michael ignored me. Then I buzzed for the 2nd time as the pain became more severe, and he came in after few minutes and YELLED at me, ""You are not the only patient here, I have 5 other patients to look after”. He left and never came back. I buzzed more than 10 times and waited for 40 minutes in my bed. My headache was getting even more severe and my hands started freezing. I started feeling so much pain that I thought I was going to die! I cried ”HELP! HELP! Please somebody help me!"" but nobody came. Realizing that the hospital staff had left me to die, I dialed 911 for help as a last attempt to save myself. As soon as the nurse heard me from outside, he came dashing in, grabbed my phone, and told the 911 operator that he was there to help. He then very angrily brought two Tylenol and shoved them in my palm without giving water. When I requested to just get a cup of water, Michael rudely replied by saying, “You can take the water by yourself. You’re not that old"". Due to the state I was in, I requested again because I truly did not have the energy to get the water myself. Michael filled up a small cup from the washroom sink and gave it to me.

Eventually the manager of Michael, Steve, came and talked to me regarding this matter. Steve started to provide an excuse for Michael, “Oh Michael was in a meeting with me, that is why he did not come. However, I will talk to him about this incident later”. I knew this was a blatant lie as during this life or death situation, I SAW Michael wandering up and down the hallway.

In the evening when my husband came to see me, this nurse Michael called 6 security guards to kick him out. 6 Security guards for one person? It seemed clear that Michael wanted to take revenge on me for the morning incident. Michael proceeded to YELL at me for the 3rd time that day, shouting ""He needs to leave right now!”. He said this even though the visiting hours were still ongoing.

Since that day I have been terrified. I get nightmares about this incident. I hope and pray that I and nobody else will ever have to be admitted to his hospital again.

You might read this thinking that I should complain to the patient relations instead of leaving a Google review. Well I did that as well. Even after complaining to the patient relations, no steps have been taken. Instead, they sent my complain back to Steve, Michaels manager, who once again did nothing and covered up for his employee’s malpractice. I write this review to warn other individuals about Michael. About his manager who does not care if the nurses leave their patients to die. About the patient relations who do not care if a patient admitted to their hospital had the worst experience of their life."

For the previous years  I've been there few times myself and with my mom. The cleanliness and wait time was terrible.The mammogram test had to be repeated, because it wasn't properly done first time.
This year I had an x-ray test and this visit was very pleasant, especially comparing to the previous experience. No appointment had to be booked in advance, I came in and registered, the staff was very helpful, everything was very fast. That's why I would give probably 3 starts now. Don't know so far if there are any improvements in Emergency room. Hopefully, the management will continue working on improving the service.

2019 update. Had a surgery scheduled at 9:30AM. The surgery was moved to the end of the day without any reasonable explanation. I had to be fasting for the surgery, so I didn't eat or DRINK for almost 24hrs and at the end my body was fully dehydrated, so when nurse tried to put IV for me she couldn't find veins while normally it was never a problem for me. I felt so bad, so I fainted. Then they had to call for the anesthesiologist to do it and after they manage it, they informed me that my surgery CANCELLED! So I has starved for whole day, poked with needles multiple times in VAIN! Looks like previous improvement was just a temporal, unfortunately."

Now speaking to so many family members and friends I can understand the reputation and score this hospital has.  First the good, overall the nursing staff was fantastic with both being empathetic and courteous.  The doctors and administrative staff was the opposite.  Specifically the cardiologist on duty who appears to be overworked. While he was in a rush I was surprised to hear he told my family members he did not want to share the details of my dad's state with other doctors as he had 'a lot of requests from family members to share information with someone else but didn't have time'. Of course we are able to sign into his tests thru an app and share it that way ourselves, it was still unfortunate.  The admin staff's primary responsibility also appeared more to flip rooms and not want to listen to concerns for the patient.  One administrator told us ""the doctors do not decide who gets what kind of room, we do"" yet were unfamiliar with medical conditions.  In a stressful situation where a parent is sick, those experiences stick with you, and when possible I will never send my parents back there if I can help it.  Of course choice is limited in emergency situations.  In cases like that I urge people to take their own notes and advocate for their loved ones.  This hospital primarily operates as a business and adds to stress rather than helping to relieve it."

I am writing you about a exceptional experience I had at your hospital under the care of 2 exceptional doctors.
I wanted to start by saying because my wife and daughter are both medical professionals that work as nurses in the system I am somewhat aware of the difficulties facing you in the hospital environment day in and day out.
I felt compelled to send a note to someone about these 2 fine professionals.
It started with a very efficient registration complete with staff to guide me to a waiting area immediately after I finished the automated registration which I found easy to use.  It was followed by a long but understandable wait given the volume of patients in the waiting area.
I was first seen by Dr Diana Leucute, who not only made me fell comfortable but spent time to explain condition and solutions while reviewing all the test I have had prior to me seeing her.  She was patient and made me feel like my case was important and questions relevant.
Then we were joined by Dr Vincenzo Basile who again reviewed my case with us both and added some help understanding my future and possible treatment.
Why I find this so amazing, is both these docs were busy but made me feel like my questions and time was as valuable as there’s.
Something I know hard to do in our current health care system.
It was important to me that I made this known because I am sure you hear more of the contrary and more patience should pass along there positive experiences in your hospital.
Please feel free to pass my comment a along as I think that your staff and team should be proud of what you are doing.
Sincerely,
Joey"

My mother was a nurse and my grandma was a doctor. The experience I had at Mackenzie Health is shared based on my personal experience with specific people, it is not a criticism of the entire healthcare staff. In conclusion, don’t go to this hospital if you have any choice.

I went to the ER at 8AM for a severe pain in the abdominal area. I have a history of gall bladder slush and I’m 90% sure it is the same problem. When I arrived in pain and sweat, barely walking, I had to wait 30 min in triage while 2 nurses at the registration were chatting. When I was asking if they could help me, both of them said just sit and wait. I couldn’t sit straight and I was leaning against the wall to ease the pain, they occasionally yelled out, sir just sit. After registration, I waited at least 1 hour before I could go in for a nurse to ask me what’s going on. The treatment room was 30% occupied at the time. Once I’m in the treatment area, a nurse trying to set up the IV failed twice. I asked for someone else to do it and it worked on the first try. I can safely conclude that it was the lack of experience on the first nurse. After they took my blood and urine, I waited an hour before they showed up to ask for my blood sample again due to machine failure or something. Without explaining it, they asked to poke me at a different area to draw the blood while the IV was perfectly working. I said ok and the male nurse/doctor poked me 3 more times and failed. I was very frustrated and suggested just take the blood from the established IV. He did and then it worked. 20 mins later, someone asked me to give urine sample again. And then asked me for another blood sample. I asked why. He just simple said. I don’t know. Just do it. Let’s go. After I’m done getting my sample again, I was sitting in the treatment and saw a senior went up to the nurse desk and ask what’s going on, it’s been a few hours. The nurse refused to talk to him and just said go back and wait. He wanted to speak with someone, so he asked anyone I can talk to, I want to leave. The nurse said don’t raise your voice and then they started arguing. The tone was extremely condescending and the senior didn’t speak much English. Moments later, the security came and asked to see his phone and ask him to sit and not move. It made me extremely uncomfortable when the nurse called the security and basically forced him to give up treatment and leave. I went up to the nurse desk and asked how much longer I have to wait, she said she doesn’t know. She doesn’t know who’s my doctor and 5 hours wait is not so bad. I asked her to find out so I can leave because my pain is gone before they gave me any pain killer. It’s been too long. She never got back to me and until I saw my doctor and requested him to look into my file, that’s when I was discharged. While preparing discharge paper, the nurse took my BP and got distracted and forgot to remove my IV. I told her to focus and finish my part before moving on to someone else, she told me that’s not my business. I can clearly see that she was unorganized, tabbing on different screens for another patient because someone asked her while she was taking my BP. It was a simple task to take BP, remove IV but it took her more than 20 min to discharge me, not mentioning she forgot to take out all of my sticker for ECG.

My painful experience with the bedside manner of the nurses and their tone of voice was reflected in many other patients. It’s truly disgusting how they feel so condescending to vulnerable people and abuse their status as health care worker. I’m more offended by their treatment of the senior than the lack of skill and management. The latter can be trained, but compassion and respect is hard to train."

She left and later another manager came and he asked what happened.  I explained him . He felt bad and said what he could do to fix the problem. I told him that patients should not be left in care of such cruel person. After he left the higher manager came and  apologized.  I am sure the first  nurse and the one who was making a case against me had hurt other patients. The Surgeon was very good and the surgery was done good.

There was no real wait time. (I don’t count the 2 minutes between taking a number and being called a wait.) The directions of where to go next through the whole process were clear, unambiguous, given to me on paper and verbally. Everyone we encountered was polite, and eager to help. The waiting, examining and procedure rooms as well as the halls were all very clean, well lite and pleasant.

At the first appointment, everything was on time, people were cheerful & helpful, and the whole process from walking in to leaving the building (yes including the CAT Scan) was 20 minutes. I thought we might have been on Candid Camera…. When we had the next appointment we joked, “What are the chances we could receive the same level of service”. Apparently the answer was 100%, because the second appointment was no different than the first. Same for the subsequent appointments.

I offer kudos to all of the staff at Mackenzie Health for making a trip for tests at the hospital a very pleasant experience. The level of service we received was terrific and I wish that all other service oriented business in Canada would match it.

Actually the only difficulty I had was trying to find where on the Mackenzie website is the page that I could enter these comments!

Keep up the fantastic work!"

Dr Marchie is professional and pleasant, takes his time with every patient.

The technicians and staff at the clinic were super kind and welcoming, and were constantly expressing their gratitude for having volunteers there. The work basically comprised of prepping items for each mammography (cutting cleaning sheets, folding the linen), and greeting the patients who came in for their appointment. In sum, repetitive, mindless work for 4 hours a week, but that was expected as a volunteer.

However, my primary issue was with the volunteer department at Mackenzie Health. When I first started, the admin assistant, Stephanie, was pleasant, and flexible with paperwork. In hindsight, I think its likely because in the summer, they receive an influx of high school and university hopefuls providing the hospital with free labour work. I was asked to submit a $30 refundable deposit, and received a receipt outlining that I was borrowing hospital property (golf shirt uniform, ID badge). I realized after my month that I didn't want to continue volunteering there, because I felt that I could better spend my summer elsewhere. I think that as I was providing a service with no compensation, I deserve the right to decide whether I want to continue or terminate my position at any time. When I went to return my ""hospital property,"" she (Stephanie) was on the phone, and just grabbed the ID badge and waved her hand at me when I tried to return the shirt. She then quickly said that my deposit would be returned in the mail. More than a month later, I received only half of the deposit back. Although it does not seem like that big of a deal, I think it really says a lot about the character and fitness of the department to be misleading and in a sense, fool their volunteers. $15 is not a lot to the hospital, but for me, it's an hour of minimum wage work, but calling it a refundable deposit while simultaneously issuing a receipt is deceitful. Additionally, when I called to inquire, the woman on the phone simply said she would let her bosses know.

I hope that this can help future volunteers be fully conscious of their agreement."

After 6 hospital visits (3 at RHMH) and 3 ultrasounds later my daughter was finally admitted to have her gallbladder removed (it was perforated and inflamed).  The ER doctor was amazing, he didn't question her pain and admitted her to have surgery.  The surgeon was wonderful too!.  The issue I have is my daughter has an allergy to ibuprofen (we documented it in all her hospital records and she was wearing a red band that stated allergy), she was given ibuprofen based medication in recovery.  I don't blame the nurses as they are overworked and trying their best, what I am furious about is that they tried to hide it.  No one told us that she was given ibuprofen medication and she had a strong reaction (given 2 doses of Benadryl).  My daughter had to tell us that she overheard the nurses say how she was breaking out in a rash.  When we asked the overnight nurse what medication she was given, the nurse was not able to find it in her chart.  We found the 2 doses or Benadryl but nothing else.
How sad is it that this needs to be hidden, what would have happened if my daughter suffered side-effects from this, would it also be covered up.  Very Shady and SAD."

What a phenomenal team of workers!! We were absolutely blown away by the support and care we received. They worked beside my midwife team with ease and cooperation. We met a lot of people, from many fields, and each person made a difference. Complete strangers helping me physically, mentally and emotionally in a lot of uncomfortable situations. I was beyond thankful. Each Nurse and Doctor made me feel like I had family beside me. The encouraging words, a kind touch or a laugh went a long way. They took the time to listen, explain and make me as comfortable as possible. Even the food was good which made the experience even better. Yes this hospital is old and not everything worked but we just went with it and tried to be understanding. The nurses did their best to help with certain important fixes and handled it all extremely well by staying positive and smiling. Dr. Gryn and his team in the NICU were amazing. Nurses like Melissa and Nilo really took the time to answer my questions and really care about the health and well being of our daughter. Regular communication and updates took place between us even after we left the hospital. Huge thank you to everyone that impacted the birth of our beautiful daughter."

His shoulder was hurting him pretty badly, but I wasn’t sure how serious it was. I was going to take him to emergency at Mackenzie Health Hospital, but I didn’t know if I’d be waiting long and I didn’t want to take a spot from someone with a more serious need if this really wasn’t that bad. So, instead, I took my son to the Mackenzie Urgent Care Center in Vaughan. It was almost 4pm (opening hour) anyway and I figured the wait might not be long. Well, I was so impressed that I wanted to share my experience. There were a few people ahead of us already but it only took a few minutes before we were got checked in and then it was probably only about 5 minutes before we got called to see a doctor. I was surprised and very pleased at how speedy and organized everything was. The doctor was very pleasant and didn’t rush us—and he was very gentle with my son’s shoulder which was most important. We got x-rays right away and then it only took about 10 minutes for the doctor to return with the results and next steps. Sadly, my son has a broken collarbone, but at least we found out quickly and could start taking care of things right away. The doctor even called a doctor at the fracture clinic to share the x-ray and determine the best approach for my son. The doctor answered all my questions patiently and before long, someone came back to the room with a sling and showed me how to put it on my son’s arm. By the time we got back to the front desk the receptionist had already booked our appointment at the fracture clinic and had the paperwork ready for me. This was amazing, efficient, and friendly service. Although we were there for an injury, the doctor and staff at the clinic made everything go smoothly. I don’t think we were there for more than an hour in total. Awesome. I wanted to give the team at the clinic a shout out for the great service. The following week we had our appointment with the doctor at the fracture clinic at Mackenzie Health Hospital and once again it was a really good experience. There were a lot of people in the waiting room but a friendly volunteer directed me and I got my number to register. I thought I'd be there for a long while, but we were called fairly quickly to check-in. It was probably only 10 minutes before we got called in to a room to wait for the doctor. I figured we'd be waiting there a while but once again we were attended to very quickly (literally about 2 minutes later). The doctor showed us our son's x-ray and after a quick discussion to answer some of our questions, we were done. I was so pleasantly surprised. I was planning to be there for a couple of hours but we were done within much less than an hour. I have to say how impressed I've been with everything and how well taken care of we have felt. My son is doing well and I feel confident with the care we've received. I don't always take the time to write reviews, but I wanted to share my positive experience and say thank you to all the staff at the hospital and urgent care clinic."

The nurse who treated me began to ask me what my issue was and I explained that I had a history of anxiety but the palpitations I’ve been feeling have been strong to the point where it was concerning. She then began to berate me with questions that are unnecessary asking why didn’t I come to the hospital the first day I felt it why did I decide to wait a few days to come till today, why did I decide not to come to tomorrow. She asked these questions consecutively without giving me a chance to speak elevating my anxiety to a higher level before I arrived at the hospital. If you’re a health care professional you should understand how to ask questions without stressing out the patient and making them feel safe as you treat them but instead I was verbally assaulted with multiple questions at once. After being treated I watched everyone get discharged and I’m sitting in the waiting room thinking maybe they want to monitor me more to make sure I’m fine, I grew impatient and asked why I’m waiting and they tell me they forgot to discharge me. The lack of organization and professionalism at this hospital is concerning and they need to reflect on their procedures."

First at the triage, the nurse tried to reassure us by saying bleeding and cramps are normal, which was kind of her. But she assumed that I was reading too much on “what to expect” and I was not serious about my conditions. So then we waited to be registered patiently and after numerous new patients came in and being registered, my husband finally went to ask if they were planning to register my visit. Felt like they just forgot about us...
After registration, I was called into the room quickly. It was a mess in the waiting room...still with used supplies from the previous patient. The doctor arrived within 15 min to ask a few questions and then I was sent to do blood work and ultrasound.
At the treatment room, it was even more messy. It was a super busy night I understand....there were zero chair for patients cause a lot of family members were there as well taking up already limited space. I think there should be signs encouraging family members to stand or wait outside because I wasn’t the only patient having to stand and wait.
Blood work, I told the nurse my vessels are thin so usually nurses tend to use thinner needles. The nurse tried twice and couldn’t get my blood and after she pull out the needle the second time, she just left! I was siting there blank....pressing my my wounds. Minutes later another nurse came to take my blood.
Ultrasound, it was the only department I felt like I was being treated like a patient. The tech was kind and she took her time to explain the procedure needed.
After hours of wait, we heard the nurse told two different doctors that it was our turn next but they were both relatent to deliver the bad news. Very unprofessional and insensitive. When the doctor was finally there, he said they couldn’t confirm anything and I should go back to my family doctor in a week to find out. But I insisted and asked for the blood work results, and realized my levels were declining suggesting a miscarriage. Not only the doctor didn’t suggest any treatment and he just swiftly left our room at that point. His name is Dr Rauchwerger. We wished the doc would educate us on what to expect following a miscarriage and if we needed to return to ER under what situation.
Is that how a health care provider should be?"

Staff is friendly
Doctors pretend to care
You will have to go back for the same problem if it’s a chronic ongoing issue. I’ve become sick and tired of going back because the doctor I saw does nothing for my symptoms and they continue to persist. Literally a 2/10

Edit: I spoke with Mr. James Sweeney, Manager of the patient relations department. I informed him of how within a span of 48 hours Sunnybrook hospital was able to diagnose me with a ruptured L4/L5 disk AND get MRI imaging done PLUS I had an initial consultation with an orthopaedic specialist.
James was by far the most helpful employee at MacKenzie that I had the absolute pleasure of dealing with. Mr. Sweeney is literally the only good thing about my experience at this hospital.

It takes nothing to be polite, courteous  and  respectful.  I would say to the staff at the main entrance... put yourself in the place on the person coming into mackenzie. Vulnerable.. Anxious... needing supportive presence...

Then after one ultrasound and another 8 hour wait they decided to tell me I'm perfectly fine and sent me home. As I was walking out the door I was still in pretty bad pain. Not to mention every single nurse and doctor there was commendably rude and mean. Here we are 10 months later and the exact same attack happened. Went to another Toronto Hospital, and after doing the correct tests told me I had appendicitis and needed emergency surgery. They said an ultrasound cannot catch something like this always. When I was at McKenzie they told me it might be appendicitis but after ultrasound cleared me off from that.

Walking in to see my family in a room with all this dirt on equip that’s supposed to help him was heart breaking and in addition they gave him a small blanket as a pillow - I couldn’t get in to see him the day of his surgery cause I showed up 5 min after 7 and no one would let me in the floor to bring him his sleep apnea machine even though they kept him in the recovery area from 11 to just passed 530 and I had to travel over an hour to get back to the hospital I called numerous times and they kept saying call back in 2 hours we can’t call the recovery room to find out when he will be moved. When I talked to someone at the nurses station on the 4th floor that night they said you need to talk to someone in customer relations they are the only people that can allow you up snd I said to her I’m sure there a still visitors still on that floor and she said no way everyone left - so she transfers me and they close at 5 she obviously knew this and just wanted to get rid of me - the next day I stayed in the room until 720 and the visitor in the next bed stayed til 745pm - not one person said a word ???
I gave it a three only because of the doctor and the people in the surgery ward they were very nice and professional and when I asked for a pillow the next day someone brought one in less then 5 min - why someone didn’t do that the night before is beyond me"

For reference I'm a healthcare worker employed at a downtown hospital - MH is closest to home. Though the RN's were all hard working and pleasant, there seems to be a big infection control problem. I remained in green zone for about 6 hours and throughout the night I watched the nurses use the same 3-4 monitors to check patient vitals without cleaning between patients. I was not interested in getting C diff, lice, bed bugs, or whatever else other patients might have. Big problem - unclear if that's on the leadership/management for failing to adequately train/educate or the frontline staff."

beginning with Laura Butler who managed and approving a procedure I required in record time and Sherry from Urology who performed the procedure not once but twice, she was so caring and gentle, had empathy, you can see that she cared.

Doctor Samsoondar who is too humble in wanting to be mentioned, but this Doctor deserves a medal of honor for carrying, what an amazing staff and team work.

I can not thank you enough.

You guys are the best"

I could not sleep cause of pain in my stomach, went at 5 am to emergency waited 16 hours and they could not diagnose appendicitis treated me like junkie who needed pain killers. Emergency staff tried to send me home. If not for my wife I would be dead. She demanded CAT scan cause they were so unprofessional. It showed it was already bursted only then they start moving. Thanks to doctor and his team that saved me! But to get to professionals it is a lottery!!!!!"

We arrived at 2:20am. The nurses and Doctor that were on duty let my fiance sit there for hours and hours before attending to her. It is now 1130am and I called 6 times to try to find out if she is ok. They told me there is no cause for concern. But yet still she hasn't been attended to. I've watched people who came in way after her get treated and leave. Its funny thats in these time of racial discrimination a black female is not being treated as a human when in pain at the hospital.  This is how people die. We have been treated better in 3rd world countries. This is absolutely horrible and disgusting and I will never come back to this hospital.

As if it was not bad enough on the first one. Well the negligence is consistent. I had my hand X-rayed due to my fall on my original visit.

This is where they sent me home with a fractured clavicle that needed surgery but the quacky doctor told me ""If I was Lance Armstrong they would operate but seeing as Im not this would heal on its own!!??"". I could have bet my hand on it that it was broken.

First X-ray..""Doctor said its NOT broken"" Still not satisfied 2nd X-ray ""doc said its not broken"" 3rd-Ray...""Not broken"" 3 months later my hand still hurts looks almost like Arthritis. Went to see Hand surgeon today.

Your hand is broken-compression fracture and the piece of bone that was smashed off was absorbed by my body. Needless to say they diagnosed EVERYTHING wrong.

Let's face it, doctors are not G-ds anyone can make a mistake but after 3 X-rays I call this utter incompetence and this is totally unacceptable.

The hospital had also billed me for a sling which I never used as I had one and I personally returned it to their accounting dept.

To date they are still billing me $45 for the sling and have turned that into a project for me as to having to prove that I returned it.

All in all this hospital is a disaster that is constantly evolving. My injuries were quite common they did a poor job on ALL accounts. One must avoid this hospital at all costs. If the dollar store gets into medicine, this would be their first model franchise.

If they turn this hospital into a funeral home will make a fortune

Just adding an edit to this review. Their response below?
Comes  get this SIX years later.!!!
Never mind the  reviews here complaining about waiting 11 hours to see a doctor.

It only took them six years to see this review. Never mind the x-ray posted below the doctor should be run out of town on a rail. To Practise medicine in a third world country as his advices and skill reflects that.  Good job MH. I’ll be right over to help consult your staff about my experience. Just give me about  5 years.  I’ll get back to ya!🤣

Doctor swears it is just pink eye and to take advil. Gradually got worst and by Friday sent back to the ER. at Sunnybrook and mentioned that my eyes are very inflamed and that it needs to be seen right away and dealt with ASAP.

In other words, instead of rushing patience who take the time to visit the hospital for pain, take extra time to ensure diagnosis is correct.

Shoutout to SUNNYBROOK for helping me keep my vision."

But it's a good hospital. They take care of you, and the doctors try and be as thorough as possible. The nurses seem overwhelmed, but they are good and they never refuse to answer a question or ignore you. Which is wonderful. There is always a hit 'n miss in these emergency hospital when it come to doctors, but whenever I've gone, although the wait is agonizing especially when you're in intense pain, they've always given me the meds, treatment, and tests I need and I do feel better within days. If you can stand the pain, stay, it's a good place, good nurses and thorough doctors. Just a minimum 8 hour waiting time, usually. There are faster days, but rare."

Basically couldn't walk or move my upper body independently. Ambulance staff was great the guy in admission was great theu helped wheel me around cause I couldn't do it myself. But the older black nurse in emergency is definitely in the wrong line of work. Came out and told me to follow her, I told her I can't walk independently and don't have good use of my upper body and she turned around and with the biggest attitude told me to figure it out because SHE WILL NOT PUSH ME in the wheel chair. I never felt so alone and helpless in my life and they don't allow visitors because of covid. I am amazed that this nurse actually has a job as she is the most useless waste of space and salary."

We stayed their for 10hrs, which most of the time was wasted waiting for the nurses to do treatments. This should have been done right away according to the doctor that prescribed pain killers and fluids but instead the nurses were chatting about personal matters and left my wife in aggonizing pain for over 5 hours. I believe 90% of the night shift nurses should be fired or there should be better supervision over them so they actually do their job. Disappointed in this hospital for allowing nurses to slack off and work without supervision. Wish I could give 0/5."

They were no help whatsoever. The wait time was atrocious, and I felt like I was being patronized by the ER doctor and that my stomach pains were not taken seriously. It's like they want to get you out of there as soon as possible. I ended up being prescribed medicine for nausea which just made me more dizzy and didn't solve my actual stomach pains. I ended up going to my family doctor and they were much more help at solving the problem. At least you get more privacy at a walk in clinic."

I could get a medical degree and treat my daughter myself with the wait times.  I waited over 8 hrs to get everything done.   People around me waited 9 to 10 hours.

I figured out why hospitals make you wait such long times.   It's psychological.  If you walk in with pain in your arm or foot or whatever, they make you wait 10 hours so you leave with a headache and the pain shifts from your arm to your head.   Never again."

At lease for room 5211 after 8;30 pm on Oct 24, 2018.  Very disappointed to this hospital. Very unorganized and not a safe place for normal families.

Also we got life threatening from some other rude visitors last nigh.  The night shift manager promised us there would be security guards walk with us to the car and pass the information to the day crew. . This morning when I double check with the day crew. No one knows what’s going on.  I should have called 911, but the hospital staff stopped me."

Almost all of my visits are Emergency related and every time I visit the ER, there's ALWAYS a shortage of Physicians. You have a Huge and Massive ER packed with lots of pain and suffering patients and it's always upsetting that there are Never enough Physicians to see and service and care for the patients' tormenting and agonizing pains. I understand that there is a system of ""Priority"" and that patients with for example ""knife or bullet wounds"" are prioritized over patients with for example ""extreme body pains"". However, when the Patient/Physician ratio is so vastly far apart and on top of that, many of the staff members are very cold, callous and uncaring, it is really sad and upsetting."
