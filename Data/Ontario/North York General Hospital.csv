NYGH Baruch Weisz Outpatient Care Clinic. For Gynaecology appointments, typically these are scheduled on a Friday.

When you enter the office on the lower level, present your health card to the front desk staff who will check you in.

Seats are available in the same room, and a mounted tv is there to help pass time as you wait.

This particular mid afternoon, I experienced a longer than usual wait time of over 2 hours. Even with an appointment, I had to wait and endure the super loud reception area until finally called. At the time of my visit the staff were training personnel, scheduling patients, and sharing back and forth office banter.  Since the space is open concept and enclosed by glass to the front, sound travels very, very well there.

Regrettably, the staff were unable to give an estimate on when I would be seen.

By the time I was called in, I was seen for a few minutes until the doctor was called away for another long time.  Finally they came back to finish my examination which took a few short minutes.

I felt like I was forgotten.  This routine appointment took longer than it should have for whatever reason.  While walking out, I saw the area lights were dimmed for closing, cleaners were sweeping the floors, all the front staff were gone.   As well, it’s daylight savings time now.  I went into the clinic with a bright sky, I came out with it being totally dark. Go figure. Sometimes, that's how it goes I guess."

From the moment I arrived, my doctor and the entire surgery team were incredibly professional, meticulous, and caring. They took great pride in their work and ensured that every detail was attended to.

But what truly stood out was the compassion and kindness of the nursing staff, particularly Arlene, Andrea, Sarah, Dan, and the others who cared for me during my stay. These dedicated individuals went above and beyond to support me, always with a smile and a positive attitude. They took the time to answer my questions, addressed my concerns, and respected my wishes in every way.

The nurses were not only efficient but also empathetic, taking great care to ensure that I was comfortable and safe throughout my recovery. They checked on me frequently, administered my medications with kindness, and answered all my questions with patience and understanding.

What struck me most was the absence of frustration or negativity among the nursing staff. It's clear that they are passionate about their work and genuinely care for their patients. Their dedication to providing exceptional care is truly inspiring.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone at North York Hospital, particularly my doctor, surgery team, and nursing staff. Your kindness, expertise, and compassion made all the difference in my experience, and I feel grateful to have received such exceptional care."

I visited the emergency room twice, of course there were a lot of people because it was a Saturday but the receptionist processes everything pretty quickly. When I had my blood tests and ultrasound done, I received some bad news. The doctor asked what my native language was, and called the translator back, he found the right words of support for which I am infinitely grateful. They gave me a referral for surgery on Friday, 11/15/2024. At 9:30 I was already at the hospital, quickly went through the receptionist. Around 12:00 I was already taken to the surgery. The doctors were very responsive and compassionate the whole time. Special thanks to Dr. Kate who performed this surgery on me. They never left me alone for a minute, they gave me water and juice. Of course, there may be different cases, but I wish you to have such a positive experience as I did. And finally at 2:00 PM they discharged me and even took me down to my car so I wouldn't have to walk alone, these are small things, but when you're in serious condition, such small things are priceless! I thank everyone for your concern!"

Jeff went above and beyond to ensure my mother was comfortable. He explained each step of the recovery process clearly and addressed all her concerns with patience and kindness. He was always attentive to her needs, whether it was managing her pain, encouraging her during physical therapy, or simply brightening her evening with his positive attitude.

His dedication to his work and genuine care for his patients is unmatched. Thanks to Jeff, my mother’s recovery journey has been much smoother and less daunting. I can’t thank him enough for the exceptional care he provided."

The aftercare and information sharing was terrific. All the staff were busy but very friendly along the way.

A few days ago, while accompanying my wife for a checkup, I lost my wallet, which held all my crucial documents—credit and debit cards, my driver’s license, health card, a few reward cards, and some cash. I realized midway through the day that it was missing, but despite my efforts, I couldn’t find it. I reported the loss to the hospital security team, provided my contact information, and returned home, troubled by the potential for identity theft. I promptly took steps to secure my accounts and scheduled appointments for replacing my documents.

To my great relief, five days later, I received a call from the hospital’s security department. Someone had found my wallet and turned it in. When I went to retrieve it, everything was exactly as I had left it, including the cash (though that was the least of my concerns). This act of kindness reflects the remarkable integrity of both the hospital staff and its visitors, and it has truly restored my faith in humanity. To the anonymous soul who found and returned my wallet, you are in my thoughts. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your honesty and generosity. 😊"

I ended up at North York General Hospital when I had a concussion. I was very well taken care of. The staff were friendly and efficient. After I was discharged, I had follow up appointments to ensure that everything was in order. When I had to take my mom here because she wasn’t doing too well at one point, instead of just giving her fluids and sending her home, they ran tests to make sure there were no major issues. They ruled it as vertigo but not once was this ever mentioned to me when I had to take my mom to other hospitals. Everyone in every department is thorough. Thank you all for all that you do.

Side note, pay for parking. They have security here who do rounds quite often, and I’ve seen people get tickets."

I visited the emergency with my mom because she suddenly complained of vertigo. Everything was very slow. One nurse in the emergency didn't insert IV to the right site. We found it when my mom had a CT scan. When she had to have a contrast through the IV, staff and she found that something went wrong. They found my mom's arm swollen because the contrast went into her skin, not into the vein. After that, her arm was swollen. Although she put an ice pack over the arm, it didn't improve shortly. I was mad at how it could happen? The ED doctor strongly recommended that we stay overnight due to an MRI. After we were told by nurses that my mom was going to admit to 3N. This unit was the worst unit I've ever experienced. They said that my mom could go to the unit when the bed was ready. When we arrived there, the bed for my mom was on the hallway without a call bell. How can she get help? Of course not. She asked her nurse to get medication for her vertigo, but no one cared. I actually visited my mom in the afternoon on Tuesday. She said no one came to give meds. I went to see the assigned nurse and figured out that nothing was done. The reason why my mom stayed there was to take an MRI. After I pushed them to work hard, I figured out my mom was not even on the list of MRI. She was already admitted to the unit. What was the point of staying if the MRI was not ready? My mom and I felt this hospital treated us in a tough way. I actually signed AMA because I really didn't want to receive any medical treatment. They didn't even prepare my mom's lunch on time and new room. I know hospitals always experience short staff, but that hospital was no common sense. When I signed AMA, the doctor said to me, ""You know the Canadian health system is always like that. You should understand it. "" Well, I think it is not supposed to say that. We left because you guys kept my mom there without giving any reasonable reasons or treatment. I'm sure my mom didn't get any *proper* treatment."

I was signed in and registered within 10 mins, and nurses and staff were very mindful of my pain and assisted where possible to minimize the amount of motion i had to make.

Had to get x-rays, which took 10 more minutes before I was sedated and had my shoulder relocated.

Overall, the process took less than 30 mins, compared to 2 years ago, where I came in with the same condition and took over 2 hours and was made to walk to my x-rays. Can't really complain given the prompt relief of my pain for nothing more than my gratitude.

service can take a long time if you come in with non emergencies. people take advantage of the free healthcare and come in for minor conditions, making wait times long for others. If you have an actual medical emergency (as defined by medical professionals and not you) and communicate this clearly to the staff, service will be prompt, and you will get the help you need. Over the course of my stay, I did not notice any doctors or nurses chatting idly. Everyone looked extremely busy but still had common courtesy, which is very impressive considering the pressure placed on these individuals.

Also, don't drive yourself here. parking is pricey due to the location, which can also be difficult to navigate, and nearby free parking is a good 10-20 mins walk. The best bet is to uber or have someone drop you off in front of ER."

She’s 84 years old and had an emergency hernia surgery at North York General last Friday.

The operation was completed successfully by 12:45 AM, and she was walking on her own the same day! She was discharged yesterday and is doing well. This was her third surgery at North York General. Last year’s surgery was even more complicated due to cancer blocking her large intestine, but they removed the affected portion, and everything went smoothly. It’s been more than 1.5 years since that major operation, and thankfully, this year’s colonoscopy was clear.

Then they split up to process so you don’t wait in the main waiting room for long. The yellow waiting room has comfy chairs and I actually felt like I could comfortably take a nap in one but they called me back in fast for more testing. The nurses were all sweet and helpful, the dr was cool. I suppose if you went to the ER for a runny nose or something, don’t expect to be prioritized as you are technically wasting their time.

Secondly, my father needed a blood test before his intervention appointment. She advised us to go to the hospital the day before, which was a holiday (Canada Day). Only after I pointed this out did she correct herself and suggest going a few days earlier to avoid the weekend. This oversight could easily have been missed by an elderly patient.

Thirdly, when we arrived for the blood work, we discovered that the receptionist had forgotten to fax the requisition.

These issues create significant challenges, especially for vulnerable elderly patients. I recommend that this receptionist be re-trained or replaced to improve the service provided to the public."

I would say just one thing if you love your child and if you don’t wanna see your child crying in pain, seeing reluctant stuffs to attend your child then please please please don’t go to this hospital. Their staff are really irresponsible and insensible. my child was there for ear infection and screaming for hours and no one was there to attend her. short of doctor and nurses has become the one of the excuses nowadays fie these kind of hospitals. I have seen my daughter crying for four hours and no one was there to give her a painkiller just to reduce her extreme pain. I wish I could explain my feelings and my pain as a mother. I have never felt so helpless, neglected and disgusted the way I felt there for my daughter. I had also been there for myself, i also faced so many problems but as an adult, I can handle myself in pain or difficulties. But I cannot forgive them what they did with my daughter. She cried for four hours. people were giggling, talking with each other but no one to attend my daughter. She was the only child there and others are adults. They didn’t give priority to her. The way each staff was behaving with every patient as they are doing a favour to everyone. no one has minimum politeness toThe patients. I could have written lots of things here, but I know no one is gonna listen to us what we face each time when we go to this place. May Allah/God do the Justice to all of us."

Naturally, everyone at home was extremely worried. My husband rushed me to NYGH, despite having heard negative things about the emergency department—stories about long waits and indifferent staff. However, our experience was nothing like that!

We arrived at 7 am and were taken in by 7:30 am. The staff were incredibly kind and professional. Dr. Yashi was particularly amazing, advocating for my case and urgently finding a plastic surgeon for me. Unfortunately, I was too traumatized to catch all the names, but the two RPNs (male and female) were fantastic, keeping me informed and reassured throughout the process.

Dr. Tanzer (I hope I'm spelling that correctly) helped lighten the mood with his humor, which was much needed. Dr. Yashi and the male resident doctor managed to find a plastic surgeon for me. Though I didn't catch her name, I know she was a resident working under Dr. Mahogany. She was an absolute savior, and by 12 PM, my surgery was complete.

One moment that stands out to me was when the female RPN reassured me post-surgery, saying, ""You had God with you and you are good at heart; that's why everything worked out for you. Stay strong!"" Her words were a great comfort to me during a very overwhelming time.

Thank you so much to everyone involved. I can't thank you all enough for your care and support!"

He may be one of the most useless and incompetent physicians ive ever encountered. Somehow he was deemed capable to diagnose only a narrow range of psychological conditions based on his subjective interpretation of symptoms that a patient may not even be exhibiting. Symptoms, that in reality, actually have considerable overlap with several mental health conditions which he completely dismissed in his assessment.  He is notably jaded from on his scope of work, in addition to being uncompassionate, and unethical. His focus was considerably tunneled towards morally condemnation and  bending patients' words. He haphazardly  assessed me for a condition i did not request to be assessed for, while not once making a single attempt to assess me for the condition i was concerned i had  (which has thankfully since this incident been confirmed by 2  actual mental health professionals that did not come to the conclusion only he came to). Though i eventually found an accredited specialist from my own online research, it was completely without any support from Josh who did more harm than good In addition to being obtuse, and deceitful. He also made up lies about my medical history to support his incorrect diagnosis. Any faith i previously had in the medical system was destroyed the moment that he tried to prescribe medication that I told him i was not comfortable taking,  which he only continually tried to push by then trying to justify it as 'at least' being a second line treatment option for what i thought i had (as if that should have been sufficient).If that wasnt appalling enough he tried to lie about the potential side effects associated with the medication that he was trying to pressure me to take. Now, over a year has passed since i dealt with his miserable and demeaning treatment. Fortunately, not long after my horrific experience with Josh, i was able to schedule an appt to get properly assessed and receive the correct treatment for the condition i actually ended up having, that he dismissed in his arrogance. With each passing day, my confidence (that he once shattered) gets closer to a state of repair while also continuously  increasing in vigor that i stuck to my conviction and did not follow his questionable attempt of treatment. He completely overlooks a major aspect of ab psych/mental health in his assessmen.. if a patient experiences symptoms that arent crippling and dont impact their functionality, it doesnt qualify as a mental health disorder. He should be ashamed and lose his license to practice medicine. Its nothing short of pathetic that the signs and symptoms for the condition he was convinced he identified correctly seemed to have vanished the next day, disproving his theory. Moreover this should serve as an eye opening experience for him that contrary to what he may want to believe, I as the patient surprisingly was the only one (not including the specialist I eventually saw) to correctly identify my condition only with a 4 year undergrad in kinesiology while a physician (supposedly in good standing?) who actively practices medicine as his chosen profession, could not, and merely dismissed and paperclipped the notion of a different condition presumably because it hurt his ego  and belief system too much to consider the possibility that a patient may have self-diagnosed correctly after yrs of living of with a condition that was overlooked by health professionals and/or typically only ever presented asymptomatically earlier in life."

Fortunately during my visit at around 3am things went relatively quickly.

I had triage, registration, blood work and an IV with pain meds and fluids within about 15 minutes.

The folks at the ER were very nice albeit a bit busy. But they were understanding and accommodating to me which I really appreciate.

Stana was my technologist later in the morning and she was fantastic. She explained everything and was very professional. While waiting for the results of the DI, I met a volunteer named Christian who was super nice directing me where to wait and offered me a cup of tea as j was having trouble keeping my eyes open after only sleeping for about an hour since I first arrived at the hospital.

The green zone is absolutely the worst though. I had two different people tell me ""I can't help you"" when all I did was ask my place in line because I've been here for over 2 hours and at the hospital for over 4. Absolutely ridiculous. No empathy, nobody cares. That's a real piss off since all I was waiting for is a doctor to tell me what's in a report from DI which has been prepared hours ago.

Ultimately my diagnosis led to a surgery consult which was scheduled VERY quickly- about a week later. My surgeon Dr Jain was incredibly professional and so kind. He explained everything in explicit detail and assured me I'd be taken care of. On the day of the surgery I was really nervous but again Dr Jain was there for me, assuring him and his team would do their utmost for my safety and comfort. It's now been several days after my surgery and I am healing well though in quite a bit of pain still.

I just want to express my deepest gratitude for the countless people involved in my care from ER to OR. They do a largely thankless job and make such a difference in the lives they touch. Thank you for helping me."

Horrible experience in the ER. Took an ambulance there because I was dizzy, lost consciousness and my left side went numb. Luckily nothing was wrong with my heart so we were put in the triage to wait. Then began the horrible experience...

1) couldn't find my doctor in their system even when I showed them on my phone

2) when it was my time to see the doctor he asked me some questions about my symptoms and asked if I had a headache. I had a very minor one so said yes. On the spot he diagnosed me with a Hemiplegic migraine (extremely rare and serious I only found out later because of my own research. He barely explained what it was) and coerced me into agreeing with him in my dazed and dizzy state that I didn't need a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis because of the ""unneeded"" radiation (a CT scan is the only way to confirm this type of migraine)

3) I then explained that I had scoliosis and kyphosis and I was currently investigating with my doctor and physio if I had thoracic outlet syndrome, and asked if it could be related to what had happened. The doctor LAUGHED at me and walked away. Saying this wouldn't give me a headache. (This is now appearing to be the cause of my symptoms)

4) I then overheard him dictating his patients notes OUT LOUD while I waited for my blood test results (is this not a violation of privacy?) He diagnosed three women with migraines while I was there (assuming one was me) AND said he recommended CT scans to all of them as follow up...the scans he said I didn't need

5) THEN He started talking to another doctor in the triage giving him advice, saying that ER is lucrative if you can handle the stress because you get paid per patient you see. Essentially bragging about how many patients he saw that night. I was disgusted. I arrived at 10:30pm that evening and this was 3:30/4:00am. He barely spent 5 minutes with me it felt like he was rushing me out. This conversation confirmed it.

6) when I finally was able to leave I asked for paperwork since they didn't find my doctor in the system and they wouldn't give me anything. I have no record of my visit to show my doctor

It's the staff who were grouchy, impatient, and rude. They were horrible and even have duties of paging patients. Either they were just crunching our names or speaking very low, we could not hear and understand. They also make us wait for like forever and won't let us know until we ask what's going on or what the next step is. If I didn't ask, I would have stayed longer than the 13 hours I've been there waiting. Sorry, no photos allowed. Guess this is the scenario with most Canadian hospitals. My doctors wanted me to go to emerge and promised that it won't take me long bec of the reason I was there and that I would be taken right away. I cld hv died waiting bec I was having chest pains and numbness on my left side. Guess it didn't matter to anyone.😯"

Despite feeling like a number initially, the registration clerk's kindness quickly eased any discomfort. They efficiently confirmed my information with care for privacy. Clear directions and a clean environment impressed me as I progressed. Dr. David Edward Smith was not only kind but also involved me in the treatment plan, ensuring I understood every detail. The nurse who assessed me was gentle and efficient, maintaining a therapeutic atmosphere. Though there was a bit of chaos in the block room, the team's reassurance quickly resolved any confusion. Dr. Ip's anesthesia technique was painless and impressive. Moving to the OR suite, the team's introductions and light-hearted banter eased any nerves before surgery. Waking up in the PACU was smooth, with attentive and caring nurses like Beth and Cathy ensuring my comfort. Dr. Smith's post-surgery update was appreciated, and the option to walk instead of using a wheelchair showed their trust in my recovery. Throughout, having my partner by my side added a comforting touch. I highly recommend North York General Hospital's general surgery team for their exemplary care and professionalism. Thank you for a job well done!"

I am used to European healthcare and I have to say that the level of education and bedside manner doesn't compare, for a developed country it's hard to believe that your healthcare system is so behind.

I would recommend more regular training for nurses and doctors.

Very rude careless triage registrar
They spend more time chatting and laughing without care for people waiting to be registered. I was kicked out because I asked when the nurse can register me. There were only three people were waiting to be seen y the triage nurse but she was ignoring all of us. This was at 6pm Easter Sunday. Soon as I raised the question all of sudden the security was called and the head nurse came by and without asking any question she asked me to leave and I was escorted by three security personnel to outside the premises. All I stated was that in any emergency department there is at least one triage counter is open attending to patients. That was it. I waited over 1/2 hour because the new lady was chatting and enjoying her conversation with two other male nurses without any care for the waiting patients.
Now I am at Major Mackenzie hospital and honestly it took less than 5 minutes to wait and register. I have been living in North York region less than 5 min. away from the North York hospital for over 30 years. In fact my son was born there. However the quality of service has gone down for the last 4-5 years. I have been taking my family to many other city hospitals where the administration staff were very attentive and fast. Shame after all these years to see how certain administrative nursing staff are playing God and they this their job which is admitting the patients are more important. I was shocked to see that the nurse in order to hang on to her improper unprofessional conduct she had to lie and call for security. There was no rudeness nor there was any angry or in appropriate conduct. Everything went out of the proportion and was made into a scene by the registration nurses (only 2 of them).

Dr. Karabegvoic was so attentive. She was so confident that I'd feel better before leaving and made sure that I would afterwards. She is an angel. Despite how busy she was, I watched her take care of a few different patients, so calm and caring.

I asked for them to stop talking about trans people, and they walked maybe 5 feet further and continued to mock me out loud and within ear shot for asking them to stop. I alerted a nurse at a desk who asked me to show her who, and when I did, one of the nurses in question started yelling at me, telling me to ""SIT DOWN AND BE QUIET"" repeatedly, and then when I was crying and told him he was yelling and making me uncomfortable, he yelled ""BE UNCOMFORTABLE"" down the hallway at me.

I was told there was nothing that could be done because it's a ""he said she said"" case, and was also told I would be able to speak to someone else, but also told it wasn't a priority. Doesn't live up to the sign in the waiting room."

My child was in severe pain and atleast should have taken steps to treat with first aid. People are suffering in pain. Do you think waiting for hour and hours to get treated is normal. Attend to patience with first aid.. what good will happen by registering them first.. is that the most important thing should be done when people come to hospitals to get treated.

My daughter was in a bad collision during a hockey game. She complained about her ribs hurting and that she was having a hard time breathing. (Our concern, as was the doctor on call was that she had a punctured lung) My wife and I brought her straight to the hospital.
While sitting in the Emergency department, my daughter becomes unconscious in the wheelchair she sat in as it hurt for her to move.
I voiced my concern with the staff there and explained to the attendant what the concern was and the response from them is just wait, you're going to be next (which was about 20-30min later)
I completely understand that they see a lot in the emergency department, but when a patient goes unconscious, especially a child, at least check their vitals and make sure this isn't a bad situation where every minute that goes by could be needed.
They didn't even care to hear what was going on, they just kept cutting me off with ""your next in line to fill out paperwork"".. which is a two window process before even getting to a room.
I've heard good things about this hospital, but on this particular day, it was absolutely terrible.

Hello Audience,

I went to the Emergency block 🚨 and the receptionist guided to one of the counter where the person noted all my symptoms and directed me to the next counter. I went to that counter where he asked me to provide the health card and Govt ID . He saw then and told that my insurance company is not in partnership with the hospital as a result, I need to pay the amount upfront. So I left the hospital without signing the Consent form.

Here is the Catch 🫡😂

They sended me with the payment due bill of $1150 through mail. I was shocked 😳 literally after seeing that . Next day went to the hospital to the patient accounts & the things got resolved.

I could barely move when she returned just seconds before the alarm went off. Surprisingly, she scolded me for not stopping the alarm, despite knowing I had undergone major surgery. Her reaction caught me off guard. I explained the severe pain, almost on the verge of tears, but she responded harshly. Holding painkillers, she threatened to move me to the leaving room. I pleaded desperately. She hesitated, shook her head, and reluctantly administered the painkillers. It's nearly 7 am, and I can't sleep, pondering why she acted that way.

I was not unable to walk, each step was a lot of pain. I could not seat either. I waited on the emergency room for more than three hours without being assisted. I checked with the nurses every 30 minutes. Despite watching that I had having huge problems to walk, no nurse had compassion for my situation. They always suggested to seat and wait, which I remind them, I cannot seat. Due to the pain, I started to have intrusive thoughts, I literally wanted to kill my-self (I was thinking, maybe I walk to the street and some car can end my suffering). I explained that to the nurse, and once again I was told to seat and wait. I called my family to pick me up (no visitors were allowed on that time, due to COVID restrictions). I told my wife, that I preferred to be home and die there than on that waiting room. My wife who was 7 months pregnant by them, came. Tried to talk to the nurses. Again, we face the wall of no human compassion. They just told her; he just needs to seat and wait. I just left the Hospital and no body notice, even I was wearing a hospital band.
We went to another ER that was further away from our hope (Nort York was the closest Hospital). Grace ER. One of the nurses there when saw my status that can barely walk, immediately offered a Wheelchair, I explained I cannot seat due to the pain, I explained it has been reached level 11 in scale of 1-to-10, to the point I was having intrusive thoughts.

Injury/fracture emergency department(green zone) is worst and very slow. The nurses and doctors do not care the patients and are not responsible for the patients. After long waiting time, MD only take one minute to listen to the chief complaint of patients. Even the male nurse working for 30 years who is communicator wants to use his power to refuse to see the patients he does not like.   It seems that the hospital is his own. He does not show sympathy and caring towards the patients. His manner and attitude are not professional. It is very curious how he has passed nursing exam? The nurses in this department are not working efficiently and have time to chat each other instead of serving the patients. This department discharge their patients without any paper work including diagnosis and treatment plan. Terrible visits this evening and wasting time!  How do they treat the patients  like garbage instead of dignity and respecting.  We should appeal that the taxpayer should not pay this department of this hospital.  This staff are worst in this department we have ever met comparing with other departments and other hospitals.  injury emergency department(green zone) is worst, worst, worst in Toronto! We will give them zero star. However, we could not find zero. Do not go there if you treat yourself  as dignity."

Not an ounce of common sense? Later, my baby shower hat was told by the nurse that it could not be brought because it was dirty. Could I ask the nurse to take another one? The nurse said you could come to our nursing station and buy... After we were discharged, the nurse forgot to give me the discharge report of the baby. I needed to apply for the baby's birth certificate and so on... My husband went to the hospital three times and was told that the data had been transferred to other departments and that we were asked to contact the relevant departments of the hospital, because a report required various payments and was told that it would take 4 weeks to get it.

There is no distancing or plexiglass between ER seats, and a fresh mask is not provided to people. As of writing this review, there were many people packed in the ER having to sit right beside each other.

My original review from about a month or so ago: Lack of adequate emergency care & dangerous meds prescribed to breastfeeding mom:
1. This hospital has no ultrasounds available after 10pm, which can dangerous for certain emergencies. I had sudden postpartum swelling and increased pain/bleeding within a week of giving birth, and waited 4-5 hours with swollen legs and pain before they told me at around 5:30am that they don't have ultrasounds available overnight. They told me I could go home and come back at 9am, or wait in the hospital until 9am.

2. The treating doctor prescribed a medication and said it was safe for breastfeeding, but my OB said absolutely not because it can hypermetabolize into something harmful for the baby and is common knowledge regarding that particular medication.

There are some good doctors and nurses at this hospital, but the experience I described above, and the lack of ultrasound availability for approximately 12 hours, is quite concerning."

I have had 5 ultrasounds for my second pregnancy and so far every appointment has been terrible. Mostly, I hate that the appointment ALWAYS start much later than the appointment time. At least twice now I’ve waited nearly an hour just to get into a room.

The tech’s aren’t allowed to give any information, no spouses are allowed in the room (too distracting?), and the techs make no effort to let the mom-to-be see the screen. You aren’t allowed to talk either. Oh, and the techs always have to check with the one radiologist on staff that day, which can take quite a bit of time as well.

All in all, this is simply not a customer service oriented facility. It’s an emergency services, cancer services place and they don’t really deal with excited moms-to-be.

The emergency room call was delayed for 6 hours from 9pm to the time when the diagnosis was confirmed and the patient was given a sling. The emergency room in this hospital was like a joke, 6 hours. During that time, I saw many doctors idle, and some were still joking and looking indifferent, which made me angry. I went with a friend, and he had a high fever. In the end, he gave three bags of saline injections and lost three bags of saline. Damn it. Canadian hospitals are really bastardized hospitals"

I came to the hospital at 7:30 in the evening just to pull out the fish bone stuck in my throat. At 12 o'clock, I couldn't even see the shadow of the doctor. It's really rubbish. I don't know how long I have to wait."
