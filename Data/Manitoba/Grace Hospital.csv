Was told to be there for 7, surgery at 9. Right from the get go with the lady in admitting I had a GREAT experience. I've spent time at HSC, The Vic, 7 Oaks and St B (both patient and guest) and never had an experience like yesterday. Mercedes in the surgery day care should get a raise (she talked to the wife and I like we were old friends while doing her job 100%) the anesthesiologist and his student are kind and funny guys. The nurses in pre op who liked my beard and chatted with me are sweethearts.Taylor and Brian in recovery made me feel safe and taken care of. Hell,  even the gentleman who pushed my bed from day care to pre op was always smiling and cheerful. All the way to the lady at the front door (I think a volunteer) who made sure I could use the paid parking machine was great. Anyone who talks bad about the Grace baffles me. Just had a family member have an extended stay there and she talked so highly of the staff. I would definitely prefer the Grace over any other hospital (not saying I want to be in any hospital)"

I talked to my mom 7 hours before they called and said she was dead and gabe us no explanation. I can't even morn over her death because im so pissed off. I think the Grace hospital is a terrible hospital and the nurses and doctors are terrible and they should be held responsible for their actions. My mom was fine and then she was dead so explain to me what happened and why they are being so hush, hush about it. I will never support this hospital. Shame on the staff"

Is responsible for medical negligence in my case and is also responsible for my remaining disability. Around September 9th 2023 I presented with lower limb paralysis and severe leg numbness as well as a FACIAL palsy. He told me everything was a coincidence and sent me home saying I will be fine. What he missed is it was the onset of GBS( a possibly deadly neurological disease), I was properly diagnosed at HSC a month later and the neurological damage to my body is irreversible because of Jeremy Plett he is responsible for my life will never be the same ever again. This disease is treatable if caught early. Stay away from this doctor"

She came in with a heart attack and survived. Overnight she pressed her panic button due to being in pain. and according to my grandma's roommate she shared a hospital room with she was told to calm down and locked in a room. No help. No assistance. She then passed that same day. The hospital staff lied to us a few times changing their story with what they wrote in there notes. After we came to get her belongings we noticed the hospital staff removed some of it. Aka stole it. After reading other reviews I can see this isn't the first case of elderly neglect. It's sad so many lives have to be lost before someone does something about this terrible hospital.

Grace hospital staff have zero understanding what mental health is all about. Not my choice of wanting to be there but had endure a very ugly uncomfortable environment while dealing with my mental health. No appropriate help was provided and no understanding from the doctors. I felt  like I was a huge burden and not taken seriously. Not a hospital that is appropriately equipped to handle anyone in a mental health crisis

I had miscarriage at 3 month and was in pain. I asked for a warm blanket, they completely refused. I waited for 10 hours there, when I got my turn, the nurse checked me.

She said go to your scan tomorrow, we can‚Äôt do anything here. I waited for 10 hours, only for this advice.  Thats it. I don‚Äôt suggest to go there, if you are unfortunately facing this kind of situation.
Next day, I went seven oaks hospital, my ultrasound showed, I still have tissues, so I again waited there 5 more hours in pain to see a doctor .At that time I felt like I did mistake that I became pregnant.

I needed my IV unhooked so as to walk to a toilet and waited two and a half hours for that to happen. The nurses don't answer the call button, that only brings a guy who can't do a thing but bring you a jug to urinate in or a cup of water if you're lucky, but he can also get the nurse for you unless his shift ending or break are just around the corner, then you can just go screw. Wait times are worse than Seven Oaks, during the day even with a less than full waiting room and I hate it so much I'd almost rather suffer at home than come here for treatment. I was given so much of a drug that was only meant to relax me before an endoscopy that I lost consciousness and woke up back up in my room not knowing what hospital I was at. One in five are so bad at administering IV's that I felt like I could do it better.  I was ""scheduled"" for a procedure (the endoscopy) only to find out later to find out they can't schedule this because transport (it would be faster to walk but this isn't an option) just gets there when they get there so don't hold your breath. I would almost, ALMOST go back if I were dying but Seven Oaks is closer to where I live and even a late night skeleton crew moves faster."

Okay so i have to make a post about The GRACE HOSPITAL and its employees, which is tough to do atm because of this Pneumonia...but, I am disgusted in what I saw there today and how these healthcare ""professionals"" treated members from our community seeking care for medical concerns. They weren't as bad when speaking to me, but i witnessed this condecending, rude, inhumane treatment towards the majority of patients in the waiting room, who were nothing but polite to staff just to have the Grace Hospital employees speak to them so loudly, rude with an attitude that was to make people know that they are ""better"" than you, and then turn around and snicker and make jokes about the patients, which I also heard them do behind closed doors when I was finally being seen after 10 hours of waiting. People were cut down to size for simply asking a question. I saw zero communication skills from the staff members in the emergency room. Shame on them. If you know someone who was working in the ER room today/tonight tell them ""shame on your co-workers and I hope you weren't a part of this."" I have never witnessed such unprofessionalism at this level in a hospital in my entire life. If i have the strength tomorrow i may try and find out the best way for file a complaint is on behalf of the entire waiting room. People gotta be better than this, gotta be better..."

A female staff member asked me for my medical coverage cards. Copied and returned. That was the only contact entering and leaving that dealt with payment. As an American, I was amazed. Paperwork is the name of American medical service.
I did receive a bill today, already paid the EMS bill several weeks ago. I did end up in an emergency room bed, sharing the space with an elderly lady. The staff were excellent as was the treatment. My only complaint, minor really, was that the bill requires calling and requesting to pay.
Seems strange to me that their system is not more user friendly, .i.e., on-line credit card payment. Love the Canadians."

I went to the ER March 18, 2021 around 5am. I have irritable bowel disease and every now and then I get a terrible flare up. I was in extreme pain such induced vomiting. I was worried I had a bowel obstruction. Little to no empathy or care was shown by any of the nurses. When I arrived there was no one else in the waiting room. I was hysterical, crying due to pain, hard time breathing, vomiting. Last time this happened I was given an IV with fluids, a pink lady concoction and buscopan almoat immediately. I sat in pain crying and vomiting for about 1 hour when the triage nurse finally triaged me. She told me to calm down and sit up straight or she wouldn't be able to get my vitals. Im like lady I am in extreme pain, if I could make this stop I would. I told her that last time this happened I was given a medicine called pink lady and it helped with the pain.. She was all snooty and said pink lady is to freeze the esophagus not for bowels. I said well last time it helped my digestive system almost immediately. Her level of care or empathy was terrible. I had fallen on the floor and one other nurse brought me a wheel chair because my pain was so terrible. This triage nurse didn't offer to wheel me back to the waiting room or when she called my name I had to wheel myself over. I will never go back to this hospital for an emergency. Being from a different province I am shocked by the level of care at the Grace Hospital. When we moved here my neighbor said the Grace Hospital is where people fo to die and to avoid it at all cost. Most places would have me in for an x-ray ultrasound or CT scan ASAP to avoid a bowel rupture and determine the cause of pain. Luckily my husband was able to find my prescription for buscopan and came to pick me up after I waited almost 2 hours in excruciating pain. I always feel better laying down and there was no place to lay down at the hospital. I went home and when my bowels ever flare up again I will NEVER go back here. Next time I might not be so lucky and may end up septic with a bowel rupture and either die or have to have emergency surgery and a poop bag. Stay clear of this place if you can."

Insensitive doesnt come close to describe the nurses. And unfortunately because I am without family I had to bring my kids. They put us in the room meant for criminals. Cuff bars in the walls and a stretcher. Literally the ONLY things in the room. They wouldnt even get me a warm blanket or pillow. The kids grew anxious and so did I. So they moved me to a TV room in the hall!! No bed, nothing to lay on. A chair. I was happy for my kids but I was still suffering. The nurses were awful. They jabbed my arm with the IV and were not ar all sensitive of my fear of needles. They were short with me and made empty promises of food and water which I finally recieved after 11 hours. They nurse that discharged me was very kind. Ironic as I'm on my way out the door.
Dont go there. I gave it one star because the dr I had originally called continually checked on me and made requests on my behalf. It is unfortunate he wasnt able to treat me because of some new computer system they have. But he did his best."

My father in law lives on his own (personal care home pending) has had 4 strokes in the past, has Diabetes t2, HTN, obese, could not do any ADLs (activity daily living) for himself and they do the same discharge style on to him once again this second time around! First admit was due to stroke- He called us in the middle of the night to call an ambulance for him- admit to Grace x1-
They promised homecare setup post discharge yet it took them a whole month until XMAS day - that he crashed in our house during dinner!

He was then rushed via ambulance to Grace hospital once again- this 2nd time was due to -as diagnosed, cellulitis! (Hence no one was around i.e. homecare- to watch over him for a whole month!).

I work as an RN in er emerg at HSC and I've seen seen the 'horrible- nurse family complainer' once in a while in my 10 year experience. I hate having to deal with them im sorry- but this im worrisome with GH's decision for discharge! Hence we were patient with the 'whole month' that home care off of Grace Hospital did not get back to my father in law- we were 'understanding' with their MIX UP. BUT this second time without one setup boggles my mind! I have filed a complaint with patient relations and WRHA. I hope someone gets stuff straight and DO NOT WISH THIS onto anyone of your loved ones to happen to them- VERY UNSAFE diacharge
