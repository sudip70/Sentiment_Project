Then you have the parking meters that people have trouble using, you can't use debit, just credit or have to use the change side, so not only do you have to find an ATM but you have to get change for a $20 bill. They need to update this system so people are able to use either credit or debit we are in 2024 not 1990s not impressed with this place. The good side tho is friendly people. I also noticed that they charge way more at this time than any other, and are not as friendly either."

So we came to urgent care and the nurse(Blonde, glasses) who triaged him was not very nice. When my son told her that he hurt his finger and how the clinic told him to come to urgent care she raised her eyebrows and questioned him as to why he came after he had just told her why. She made him feel like he shouldn't have come here.  My son sat down and said why did we come here. This is the worst interaction from a nurse we have ever received. We will not be coming back to this Urgent care hospital again. We come for care not to be made feel unwanted by nurses who obviously don't like their job."

Just one doctor in emergency ward during Night shifts. Do something better. People are sick, getting seizures while waiting. It’s more than 6 hours  while waiting to see doctor but nothing.

Doesn’t recommend this place. I think management doesn’t even care to put more doctors at emergency wards during nights. Shameful"

This is called as urgent care but nothing here is considered as urgent. I have been waiting here for 6 hours and I haven’t been seen by doctor yet. The reason of my visit today was there were 4 stitches made on my finger due to a deep cut. It was done by two of the medical students without the supervision of doctor. I dont think that any experiments should be made on someone’s injury. Doctor should treat instead of medical students. One of my Sitches was placed wrong and I had to come again to get it placed right. This is totally unacceptable and if you go to triage nurses for asking wait time they would respond. I don’t know you have to wait beacuse you cut yourself. No, I didn’t cut myself it was an workplace accident. Treat someone with empathy and respect if you are frustrated with your job just leave…"

I visited 7 Oaks Hospital twice for Urgent Care following my car injury, once for my elbow and again for my concussion. During both times, the triage nurses were very rude. The first time, I was treated fairly quickly but the doctor was only in the room for 2 minutes to talk to me. He prescribed me pain medication and quickly sent me on my way. The nurse treated my wound and sent me off with some bandages but did not teach me how or how often I should change it.

I came back the next day because my head was pounding. I actually went to a walk-in clinic first and the doctor there told me to go back to 7 Oaks for some scans due to my concussion. I went back and instantly regretted my decision. I waited about 4.5hr to be told I only had a ""neck sprain"" and the doctor talked to me in a very condescending way, like I was a child. He only offered me 1-2 days off for a note when my head/neck was immovable. No note for physio or chiro either even though it's covered by insurance. Even with pain medication, I still have really bad migraines. Despite that, the nurse that assessed me was very kind and nice.

I just want to say that I am very disappointed with my experience here and unfortunately won't be coming back. I feel as if it's more worth my time if I drive further for better care at another hospital."

It seems like they didnt take it as serious pain even when he rated it 9.5 out of 10 (He is in so much when we got there). We waited patiently, trying his best even though he is hurting so much and as hours passed by, it toned down.

They took blood pressure test around 10:30 pm and was told that there's one more person before him to be called and they are also waiting for a bed. Waited again for more than an hour, 11:50pm (the pain's gone by then) and was told to wait again and they will get another blood pressure check. Feeling very frustrated, he left without getting checked because he drained his energy with the pain and with the long wait.
Other people were called before him and they can even walk properly and does not seem to be needing 'urgent' care. It was so frustrating."

My situation was still manageable but there were people , especially really old people who would need someone to look after them and it was so painful to just see them helplessly sitting there.

The front desk staff ask my father if I can speak English like yes I can but the thing is I am trying not to speak so I do not vommit creating more work for all of you. She goes "" oh yes it's always this busy blah blah to my father"" like okay and you chose this job I did not so can you do it without complaining and being unprofessional. I understand how frustrating it can be being a health care worker but to just  have an attitude while dealing with patients is unacceptable. I left the facility with zero help and disappointment. I was not only judged by the fact I was anxious but judged if I can speak a language. Than if you bring such things up they say they are not judging you. Previously I have gotten blood work done there and the worker was extremely rude she says ""I don't have all day"". I was sitting in a psych office like do you have any sympathy at all.

It was a great experience right from the time my husband and I stepped through the door and was looking at the information map and an elderly gentleman politely asked if he could help us find our way. He gave us directions to the day surgery clerk who was also very polite. We were then directed to a waiting room where we sat for no longer than 10 minutes before a nurse asked me to follow her to the day surgery area. After putting on my surgery gown I was asked to get comfy in a reclining chair with a heated blanket. The nurse who then looked after me was so wonderful! Full of energy, kind words and humour! During my wait for surgery my heated blanket was replaced two more times! The professionals in the surgery room were great! Dr Hubert was the surgeon and he explained the whole procedure as he performed his tasks and I watched on a monitor.
The recovery room nurses were very nice and back at day surgery room after was again a great experience.
Thank you all for making a possibly stressful day into a wonderful experience!

All my experiences at the triage have been completely terrible. They're inconsiderate and ignorant. There are signs that say to update them on symptoms and if you're feeling worse but they don't care about what you're feeling they only care about what they can see. I would rather die than go back to this hospital due to some of the staff. I will say though that the people doing my bloodwork and ekg were nicer and easier to work with. The people that don't like their jobs should leave instead of making the patients miserable.

First visit, they didn’t do sufficient testing, missed a deadly stomach infection and sent me home, that resulted in hospitalization when i went to HSC to get a second opinion.

Second visit, the staff are ignorant. Waited 6+ hours to be put in a second waiting room to wait longer. For a simple X-ray result… ended up leaving, unsatisfied and still in pain.

Aside from that, the Security was very helpful.
X-ray Tech was very friendly and kind.

The lack of attention to detail and disregard for basic patient needs was astounding. It felt like I was just another First Nations number in their system.

The facilities were also subpar, and the equipment appeared outdated and poorly maintained. I was appalled by the lack of cleanliness in the hospital, which made me question the overall hygiene standards.

I hope that the hospital administration will take my concerns seriously and take immediate action to address the discrimination issues I faced. Patients deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and I hope that future visitors to Seven Oaks Hospital will not have to go through what I did."

My 83 year old, disabled mother with a walker and fighting double lung cancer was admitted yesterday after 11pm. I called all over the city trying to find where the ambulance took her. Not only did the ambulance take over 2 hours to pick her up, it took till the following morning to track her down. Seven oaks told me they discharged her at 4:30 am, alone. And they didn't call anyone.

She fell twice and banged her head..yet nothing was done or even tested.

I called to inquire and the staff knew nothing. Didn't know if she was alone or not. Didn't know if she was safe to go home alone. They didn't contact no one. Plus the lady had a bit of attitude..saying well..did you try her house? Like really..you're going to give me attitude when you lost my senior mom?

If something happened to her from the hospital to home....who would be responsible?

I bet no one will take responsibility for this...so I'll just share this story until we are heard!

9:00pm last night.

She can't barely walk nor speak but the very unmindful Triage staff kept giving instructions and asking questions, even forcing her to speak more clearly or repeat her answers. I was hoping to facilitate for her since obviously, she already is in so much pain but she kept condescending me.

I believe the doctors are good but the staff, I was appalled by their seemingly lack of tact and zero sense of urgency for an Urgent Care facility.

Worse, probably she wants me to feel her superiority,  asked me to wheel my wife in an adjacent area but instructed me to wait in my car???...like, seriously, my wife is in so much pain and is almost at the brink of passing out..

appalling..that she has to be left by herself because she's been vomiting...for crying out loud! That doesn't make any sense!!!"

The night my mother died I went to tell the nursing staff in that area that I thought she had stopped breathing, and the person I spoke to said in the rudest way possible ""you're at the wrong desk""
Absolutely zero professionalism or empathy or any kind of caring.
They then let me drive home by myself nobody talked to me stopped me or even asked if I was okay they simply let me leave.

No treatment has been provided. Ridiculous! Still waiting. 6 hours ago they told us we would be the next. Go somewhere else!!

Completely unacceptable and unwarranted. The night nurse on Feb - 3 Feb 4 on the Urgent Care MTA area needs to be reprimanded as her racist stereotypes are completely unacceptable. She had the nerve to tell him in the peak of his pain that ""The pain won't kill you but the meds will"". Is this the level of care indigenous people can expect here?

Seven Oaks took time to address everyone of our concerns and all of my mom's physical complaints. They let us talk to each of the specialists involved, and provided a treatment plan. This also included  getting the right balance of medications and home care in place.

Miscommunication,confusion,lack of urgency,lack of compassion,poorly trained.......and on it goes.
I have lost two family members in this hospital.The experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. There are a few nurses who are shining stars in this hospital but unfortunately there are too many who just don't give a damn about patients or relatives. Not calling family while a patient is in the final hours of life is unforgiveable. Giving a patient a drug to render them completely comatose until death without consulting family first is another unforgiveable.
Then you have some old doctors who are worse than nurses making the rounds and putting in time till retirement. They evade patients families whenever possible and rarely show up on time for a meeting if at all.
They misdiagnose conditions or prescribe wrong meds. If your family member is senior they basically just write them off. So many patients are overmedicated until they die but it makes for easy care by the nurses and doctors. People don't believe how bad this hospital is until they experience it first hand."

Explain I couldn’t swallow anything and I got nothing ,  then after the doctor left he said I would get something for pain , and they would take blood 15 minuets later got my blood taken and then 45 mins later still waiting for pain meds , went and asked and the nurse told me there is nothing she can do for me because I cannot swallow anything , I work in the health care system there are other things you can do , but the nurses rather stand around the desk and talk instead of actually help people, if I wanted to sit and deal with this I would of stayed at home I came here to get help , and I got nothing . Doctor finally came back and is giving me an IV hooray!!!"

It is a place filled with fear and questions. A simple requirement to being employed in a place that deals with such intense fears should be COMPASSION!! Something I thought, until tonight was the reason people dedicate their lives to patient care. My view on human nature changed in the matter of minutes. A nurse on the fourth floor (I will be filing an official complaint against her) was the most unprofessional, lazy and unconcerned nurse in the profession. It was just numerous sighs and eye rolls anytime a question was asked. My precious grandmother has trouble communicating in English and this woman was clearly not of Canadian born parents so if anyone should understand the struggles of immigrants, it should have been her! She was not helpful at all and she was just a snotty, child-like nurse getting paid OUR tax dollars to make peoples lives even more difficult than it already is considering they already have loved ones in a hospital bed"

We got in to see a Dr really fast and he looked at my son's leg and foot and all he said  was keep doing what ur doing and keep poping him with pills and follow up with his dr and he said I don't need to do any test as it will be a waste. He never even said what was wrong with him or anything. Who says that to a 10 year old kid. Never going back ever again!

I brought a friend in to get a stent put in. Before the procedure the medical staff advised the patient to NOT make any important decisions until after 24 hrs had passed because he would be under the influence of anisthetic. While still in recovery two hopital staff (one a nurse) approached his bedside and asked if he would take part in a medical study. The study was to support a multi-million ( or billion) dollar drug company. Why would hospital staff approach an individual, who was told to not make important decisions, if he would volunteer to take part in a medical study (for free) to benefit a multi-million dollar drug company. Is this a breach of patient trust and unethical medical practices?"
