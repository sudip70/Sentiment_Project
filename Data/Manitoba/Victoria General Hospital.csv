My wife was having breathing problem due to muscle pull at her right back. Took her to the hospital, all they did was give 5 pain killers (2 at first and 3 @after an hour).   They said the longest wait time is going to be 4 hrs, But I waited 12 hrs , 10 pm to 10 am. Flys were moving around me and it was tough to wait in the waiting room since I was not the only person waiting. I tried to make them understand that she cannot breathe properly all the did was offer us warm blanket. After 12 hrs of wait they called us. We went inside and waited for 2 more hours, it might have been more if I didn't keep on pushing them. The end results? Doctor took an X ray and said everything is fine , she needs to rest and take painkillers. So , we have waited for 14 hrs for this? All we needed to know was take painkillers and rest at home.  We could have slept properly at our home , rather than sitting at a chair and having a backpain overnight.I became sick as well after this wait. This was my first time visiting any hospital in my 5years I have lived here. I hope , I never have to see that place again.  So called urgent care, its a shame"

I only waited 4 hours to be seen  which is excellent in this day and age of health care in Manitoba. During this 4 hours I received excellent care from Registration,Triage and Lab personnel. I also observed the excellent care and concern the security team provided to the patients and families and to a person presenting problems .
Once I was taken in for care I received excellent care from the Nurse Practitioner, Doctor, RN’s, HCA’s, X-ray staff. I also noted the care of cleaning staff in the unit
I hope that this review is seen by all your personal with my sincere thank you.
My only area of concern was the waiting room which needed attention due to people vomitimg om furniture and floor and was not cleaned up during my 4 hours in the waiting room.
I would recommend Victoria Urgent Care to everyone. Please do not blame the staff for long waits. Put the onus on your government!"

Firstly, awhile back I went there with severe kidney pain to the point of where I had to lie down on the floor for some comfort and by that time we’ve already been waiting hours. When I was finally seen, a male nurse came in and he was so grumpy and in a way uninterested in caring for me. He gave me a urine sample bottle, I gave my sample which they lost, I have no clue how but they lost it. I was finally seen by the doctor and was told I was fine even though I was profusely sweating from holding in the pain. Secondly, an ambulance took my mother to Urgent care at around 2am, she was having pretty bad coughing fit and she fought through the severe pain she had in her whole stomach area and between the ribs. She waited for almost 13 hours and she was the last patient to be seen. How ridiculous is that? Do they not care? I then decided to sign her out seeing that she will not be seen for more hours to come. That is the last time we will ever go to Vic"

First of all the waiting room was packed and someone who experiences high anxiety when there is larg crowds I was unable to sit in the waiting room. And preferred to sit in an area with less people and a lot more quieter.
I was not doing well that particular night and was highly suicidal. I just needed some help.
I understand I had to wait my turn like everyone else. What was so disappointing was one particular nurse from the mental health accessment unit, came out loudly and told me I had two options, sit in the over packed waiting room or send me home. I explained my anxiety to sitting in a packed waiting room and expressed I was suicidal.
I have been numerous times to the mental health assessment unit and have felt compassion, patience, and understanding from certain nurses. But that night was completely disappointing. Not only did I have everyone in the waiting room hear my struggles but having a professional mental health provider tell me I manipulate the nurses, which is false, but they also loudly recap previous visits so everyone can hear my personal struggles. My personal imformation. Very unprofessional. The nurse gave me two options remember I'm highly suicidal and needed a safe place at that moment. 1.  I sit in the waiting room which I couldn't do or they send me home. I expressed to the nurse how I was feeling unsafe to leave and was highly suicidal.  The nurse response ""well that's your choice if you harmed yourself"".  I couldn't believe the treatment I received from that particular nurse.
No one should be judged by past experiences or even be treated because of their mental health diagnosis but to be treated with compassion, understanding, patience and most of all as a human being.
I've lost all trust in the mental health assessment unit staff and will never go back. Luckily, I survived that night but came very close to ending it. What I don't understand is why would anyone especially mental health professionals send someone home when that individual is a high risk to hurt themselves or even die. No one should feel the way I felt and experienced that night because it would be such a tragedy if someone lost their life to suicide because they were sent home when all they needed was a safe place and some compassionate help."

If you have an age restriction you should properly post it and have the desk tell you to go somewhere else cause you cannot properly treat or diagnose a child with pain under 16.

Red Alert.  There has been an ""outbreak"" on 4 South.

The information has not been shared publicly with those required to attend that hospital.  Only a sign at the first floor elevators alerts one that the possible threat of exposure at that hospital exists. Upon entering there is no requirement to wear a mask. The staff don't.  The visitors don't.  The patients don't.  And because we don't have memories like sieves,  we still do - wear a mask and on occasion use the professional quality hand sanitizer provided by the publicly funded health care facility  You?  Little sympathy for those not living in the world we do.  Containing the spread of a virus not this country's strength.  Nor are adequate resources to assist those who through no fault of their own are infected.

My beloved husband and bff of 35 years who is 74 years of age and just diagnosed with prostate cancer (apparently easy to treat successfully at this moment in time) knows how to protect himself to the extent that he can but clearly cannot protect himself from those who care little about his life.

Deja vu.

Neither could my mother, the victim of an unnecessary medical procedure (treatment for stage 1 cancer of the uterus that had not metastasized) that forced her into the health care system during Covid because of vaginal hemorrhaging that could have caused her death.

This test that my husband was scheduled for very suddenly and unaware for what reason, related to what health problem? It was a scan of his upper body and his pelvis.  The scan of his lower body performed there approximately 2 weeks ago.  I did not attend with him the first time.  No bus fare to get there.

off the chart angry.  And very interesting reading material related to seniors while waiting.   Not Zoomer magazine I hope.

BTW is it normal/natural to suffer the constant pain associated with endometriosis/itis because there is no treatment that is effective.  I suffer from it.  No genetic predisposition to any of these diseases.

This is the healthcare facility that one is transported to by a paramedic as it is the catchment area defined by whoever.  I have attended to this facility many times.  The last time for a fractured skapula that was identified as related to a fracture of the sacroiliac joint by the Xray techician,  Thank God for the quick thinking Emerg doctor that thought my arm should be in a sling.  Not my ass.

Maybe finally ""theirs"" should be. Always ask others for their opinion only if you want to listen.  Anyone else think so?  Share or not.  We don't care.  Our voices matter as much as those of anyone else.  Or do they?  Both the members of the Federal Liberal Party and the Provinical NDP often visit this particular publicly funded healthcare institution.  Why?  Posting a photo of my bff.  Enough of a sympathetic figure?  British immigrant to this country in 1959 but a Canadian citizen now only."

You will most definitely wait a minimum of 4 to 6 and usually 8 or more hours even just for the results of a test that they called you in for.

ANYTHING non-lifethreatening you are better off seeing your GP for. Or go to one of the other hospitals in the city. Hopefully the administration of this hospital can stop wasting tax payers money and address its bottlenecks. I unfortunately doubt it.

The ONLY saving grace is the nurses are really nice.

EDIT: I would like to say that I do understand there are many factors to fixing the bottlenecks, I think a ""blue seal"" like the ""red seal"" could help fast tract individuals who have healthcare training and education from another country, to be able to work in our Healthcare.

In the states they take a competencies tests then start working, here is a bunch of red tape."

On May 4th I admitted my mother to Concordia urgent care for vomiting and severe dehydration. From the moment of arrival the triage nurse was empathetic and went above and beyond to help. Despite a busy evening my mom was given a comfortable recliner to sit in, immediately given anti nasua injection by the triage nurse and within 2 hours was given an IV. Within 5 hours my mother was admitted, treated and discharged.

Sadly the next day May 5th I caught whatever she had, but this time I chose to go to Victoria hospital as it’s closer to home. From the moment of arriving it was a severely different experience. The nursing staff seemed annoyed by every patient coming in, I was given nothing to stop my vomiting until after 7 hours I practically had to beg for gravol. I waited 12 hours to finally be seen by a doctor and was not even given a bed but rather placed in a random room that stored medical supplies and given a chair despite not having slept or laid down in 12 hours. What added insult to injury was there was a bed in the hallway outside the room not being used. This is completely unacceptable. While the state of our provinces health care has always been horrendous, it cannot be so vastly different in terms of service from one hospital to another within 24 hours. While some things like staffing, volume of patients, etc cannot be helped, there needs to be empathy and some effort from the staff. Waiting 12 hours to be treated for nausea and dehydration is unacceptable."

One doctor working the Er for the whole hospital. Which I don't know if that is a common now for our health system.  But definitely short staffed there.

Jackeline the triage nurse in front was very kind and sympathetic and there  seems to be a good monitoring system as far as monitoring peoples vitals in the waiting room.

Native gentlemen that was in the waiting room that had what looked like severe mental health issues was screaming and banging his head while children were present not a very nice environment for children to be witnessing. As well for people who are already under stress because of why they are there for in the first place.

Five security guards at the back and lots of police there and no one intervened at all which was crazy.

There should be a separate mental health facility for situations of that nature.

Once I finally got in to see a doctor for abdominal issues that I was having. He basically wanted to discharge me upon two seconds of talking to me all because my general blood work checked out. Did not want to bother to feel my abdomen for anything out of the ordinary or do any sort of imaging.
After about ten minutes of me advocating for myself he begrudgingly  ordered an abdominal x ray. Even though I know I was well warranted a CT since I have been dealing with issues over a year now.

I continued to have to advocate and he ordered an outpatient colonoscopy. I wanted to see if I had a bladder infection as well and he told me.. ok... I can call you with the results... what?????

I refused to leave until I had them. Turns out I had a mild infection.

I Asked if I could get a copy of the stuff that was done so I can take it to my family doctor and they refused and said I have to go through medial records. They said it was against their policy to do that. ""Even though I got dozens of records before at other hospitals I went to.

I Asked if I could get a pelvic exam due to my symptoms and was refused, as well and tumor marker testing and was also refused.

Horrible experience left crying and upset. Felt unheard dismissed and not listened too after twelve long hour wait.

If you suspect you have cancer and want help. Would highly not recommend coming here. No compassion  just want  to kick you out ASAP is the vibe."

There is never less than and 6-8 hour wait. The place looks and feels dirty, even though they say they put patients in order of risk I've seen pregnant women with bleeding go after kids with that for all intents and purposes were running around like nothing was wrong. And after you pass the waiting room you still have to wait at least an hour for the doctor to come see you. One time I even overheard the nurses saying that they only had one doctor on duty for everyone. This time there were 7 people in the waiting room and nobody has been called into a room for almost 2 hours. There is no water unless you are willing to buy it from the vending machine and if you drive here you will need to pay for parking. If you can find a spot in front of the urgent care, that is. Last time we waited for 6 hours to be called into a room just to wait another hour or so for the doctor to see my wife. He then proceeds to talk to her the a solid 2 minutes, order an ultrasound that the hospital scheduled for over two weeks later and disappears into the night. I will never be coming here again. Not even dragged. I rather drive three times farther away from my house to go to Grace, HSC, or St. Boniface. Don't waste your time in this dump. I am from a third world country and this kind of service is deplorable even by our standards. Of all the reasons to love Canada this kind of pathetic  healthcare service is the one thing I hate.

EDIT 1: It took them 6:20 hours to get us out of the waiting are and into a room. After that, another hours and a half, give or take, for the doctor to come see us (I had to go and complain that we were in the room for over an hour with no one even talking to us). We were told my wife needed an ultrasound but because it was 6 in the morning we had to wait until 8 when the techs would arrive.
Comes 8 AM and nothing, comes 8:30 and still nothing so I go ask and it seems they will fit us when they have the time. Which means it could be at 11:30 AM or it could be never. We remain waiting. 12 hours and counting.

P. S. :This is ridiculous we are occupying a room that could go to someone else if they just did the ultrasound and passed it on to the doctor."

The nurses were really exceptional. The aides were awesome and very professional and the doctors were great as well. Great communication all around and everything was triple checked or more. They were also very helpful with other patients who were a bit more complex than I was. I noticed a few of the seniors were in need of some extra care and they got it right away without asking. The nurses also caught a few things like people who had eaten before surgery and some other small things that really stood out to me. I own medical clinics and a pharmacy and would be proud to work with any of the staff I was around yesterday.
The facility itself looked very clean and nicely maintained. I'm sure the staff know of a few things it's actually in need of but everything I saw was working and clean.
I know we rarely get to choose which hospital we want for stuff like surgery in Canada but if I could I would choose VGH every time! If you get the staff I had then you're in for a nice, calm experience with incredible nurses, doctors and the important but often forgotten support staff!
Hats off to VGH!"

Call lights go unanswered for 15-20 minutes. Everytime of the day I'm there it was the same long waits, even at nights. Multiple data points at different times of the day will illustrate a trend. Patients are suffering because of this. A critical incident will happen one day because a patient will try to get hold of staff and staff are inattentive in the hallway charting and chatting while call lights are blaring around them. Charting is important but patient care is more important.

Patients soiling themselves in bed because nobody answers lights to help them. My father calling me at 2am in pain and I'm having to call the front desk from home because he pressed the light and nobody is answering in a reasonable time.

Staff ignoring call lights as if it's someone's else problem, every staff member should be taught to check out a call light not walk past them this includes nurses not just HCAs. Terrible training on the unit. Everyone is fixated on their own tasks they forget the #1 job, care for the patient. Meal trays need to be handed out but if someone is in pain or need to use the commode, the  meal trays can wait, triage!

5 patients in a 4 patient room, no proper call light or privacy for the 5th person jammed in the middle of the room exposing themselves to all who walk in. Also further creating a falls  risk in a room filled with high-falls risk patients.

No attention to basic patient hygiene such as daily oral care or even changing dirty gowns.

No attention to rehabilitation and getting patients stronger and walking. Everyday patients stay in bed they become more and more deconditioned making rehabilitation even harder. Research shows this!

Staff telling patients that they are wearing a brief and they can soil themselves in the brief and will be cleaned up later, how degrading! All the patient needed was a commode or a walk to the bathroom.

Patients advocacy, nurse manager and CEO who don't care and just brush it off saying their hands are tied and there is no funding. How about interfacility transfer if you can't handle the patient load you got and find a bed available for them elsewhere versus lack of care here? We flew patients out of province during covid costing tens of thousands of dollars yet they fail to look at resources across the city. Just laziness and lack of care and patients suffering.

The place is a terrible facility and should be avoided. Picture and videos of situations will be made available to media upon request and on this review page shortly"

my first roomate snored and made other noises thru the night and part of my cptsd is heightened noise sensitivity. she also was generally disrespectful during the day too. after 5 nights with the first roomate and being unable to sleep, my mental health deteriorated quickly. my nurse, jess, was able to move me to another room, saying there were no noise issues with the new roomate. which was not true. i only spent one night and due to her speaking on the phone and snoring lightly and making other noises, i was unable to sleep. there was also a washroom in the new room and the roomate would flush it while the door was open at any hour, like 3:45am, after NOT washing her hands. the flushing was extremely loud and thus while i had managed to doze off due to exhaustion at around 1:30-2am, i was awoken less than 2 hours later. * i am well aware of my noise sensitivity and thus sleep with headphones or earplugs and when it is very noisy i will listen to music.

aside from the roomate and noise issues, the dr i was assigned (dr doron yehudaiff) was NOT very professional: he not only criticized my showing emotions when speaking and reliving trauma, he then critcized me for expressing why i had trepidation and fears bcuz i shared what has happened to me from so-called health professionals in the past. as i am a first nations woman in canada, i have been greatly mistreated and disrespected bcuz ppl think i'm some sort of savage idiot. meanwhile i have 8 yrs of uni with 2 b.a.'s and have done 5+ yrs of therapy. including 2 yrs of cbt therapy to help manage my cptsd.

i only met with him 3 times and he criticized me twice on the first meeting, after my first night. the second meeting was the morning of dec 24 and dr yehudaiff seemed much more concerned with getting the meeting over quickity-split so he could leave, he didn't even bring his books or notes. i felt like he was annoyed with having to meet me and wanted to rush me out the door. the meeting lasted less than 5 mins.

the 3rd meeting was jan 2 after i had not slept more than 10 hours over 5 nights, and i was in a mental health crisis. he told me my only option was to take more drugs to knock me out so i would be dead to the world (and anyone could do anything to me and i wouldn't know).  when i repeated this back to him a few minutes later, he gaslit me and said it wasn't my only option, that i could learn to manage the situation.

so, this genius dr figured after 50 years of not sleeping more than 4-6 hours a night due to trauma and abuse, i could learn to manage sleeping in close quarters with a roomate who made noise. and never washed her hands after using the toilet.

when i mentioned the 2 criticisms he had made if me, and how it was disrespectful, he gave me the usual response that ppl think absolve themselves of being disrespectful: ""it wasn't my intention"". frankly it matters not if it wasn't his intention or that he didn't understand how he was being disrespectful, all that matters is that he was disrespectful. i ended up by asking to be transferred to another facility or to get another dr and he said he could not do that.

so. if you have a mental health crisis and are sent to the victoria hospital, and end up with a dr who gaslights you and with whom you don't get along, you're stuck in a situation that won't help you. thankfully i was there voluntarily.

long story short, i checked myself out bcuz i was being triggered into having cptsd attacks by my dr and the situation, and my cptsd attacks make me want to end my life. which is how i ended up there in the first place.

thankfully, i made it through the night, i finally got some sleep and am a bit rested so i am now looking to go to another hospital or mental health facility before i try to end my life again."

I understand the nurses and doctors are quite busy and have full respect for them.
However, I do not appreciate the tone and words spoken to me by 1 nurse, I didn't catch her name.
I was given instructions on what I should do if the medication prescribed did not work, from the nurse I had seen while I was at the hospital.
However, the nurse on the phone had no patience and spoke rudely to me.
Rather than politely apologizing for incorrect information given to me, or nicely explaining, I was told 'no, you're wrong', followed up by her hanging up the phone.

I have never written a review about such experience, but this bothered me as I am in pain and rather than support, the nurse was just rude.

I was in the section waiting for a bed in main hospital. The male was extremely patronizing with the lady and while escorting her I over heard him tell her to hurry up and not walk so slow . Seems he was almost encouraging an argument. Afterwards I pointed this out to another male nurse and was more or less told mind my own business and if I didn’t actually see the incident I should be quiet.

We came in around 9:30 and the initial wait time was about 3 hours to see a doctor. After 3 hours, the triage nurse says the wait time will be 7 hours. After waited for 8 hours, the nurse says there won’t be doctor available till morning around 8:00-9:00 am. Means it will be 12 hours wait time. Also, it’s not guarantee to see a doctor after 12 hours.

I came to emergency because of my prescription drugs no long working and I suffered from serious stomach pain for 24 hours. But I’m end end, I wasn’t able to see a doctor.

I was very disappointed!!"

Will NOT GO AGAIN!! Six hours wait to see a dr and another 4 hours for lab work!!???? The waiting room has  the waiting patients facing the office workers?? rather than face the window or anything else for that matter.
MIsercordia Hospital urgent care was MUCH BETTER! They would have patients sign a book when walking in so you know they have your name and know you are there and  then you would get called to triage. Not so at Victoria urgent care. You are met at the door and instructed to put on a mask and sit down. How do the triage staff know you are there or know what order patients have arrived or even know if your problem could be life threatening?Victoria ""Urgent"" care??? I think not. There is huge room for improvement here!"

Not all but most of the staff have no compassion, rude and when the staff is being aggressive with you when you are trying to get answers and you respond in the same tone as them you are suddenly told to leave or walk out as they did to me and I kept telling the person to slow down as I have a neurological condition and use a walker and she was walking so fast, and she told me she didn't care she wanted me out of the hospital because I had upset her staff how I don't know seeing as I was doing their job for them as they all stood around talking about non medical things such as holidays, things their family like and don't like etc.  They are the most unprofessional and hide behind their Union Status, because they know they will not be written up anyway, nor any discipline action will be taken unlike those of us who if we behaved like that in a Non Union environment would be fired for.  The signs of aggressive and rude behavior is a two way street and they don't seem to get that, it only applies to them not an advocate for the patient or to the patient themselves.  My mom went in 4 months ago a strong fairly independent person who is now the most confused and unrecognizable person mentally I have ever seen, it just breaks my heart at what they have done to her.  I am now working on getting her out of there as dying at home would be kinder than the way they treat the elderly there.   Do not take an elderly patient there or allow another hospital to transfer them there.  Unless you want them to die a slow and painful death.  And good luck trying to talk to anyone as they just brush you off as your concerns don't amount to anything.  And too just an FYI playing a movie on YouTube like one nurse was one day I walked by her desk while people who needed help as you hear all these bells going off and she was just sitting there ignoring them very unprofessional . As an ex IT worker  it makes me wonder how secure their computers are if you can access You Tube while being on a medical computer, how secure is there server system?  Food for thought if the hospital even reads their reviews.  I have never been so turned off especially with what happened today but that is another story and one I will if need be bring up in some form to either the Minster of Health or maybe the press as the Social Worker was way out of line today and again very rude, condescending, and unprofessional.  Telling me my mom doesn't want to see me when I go every day having paid already $1000,00 in 4 months to park there just so I make sure she eats there slop they call food sadly half the time she won't eat it as it is so bad and she is losing weight and muscle tone as the days go by and also is not being looked after properly, most days I find her in bed hence why she lost all of her muscle mass. Which obviously from my review you know she is not, nor is any other patient really as I have gotten to know most of them because I help them too as best I can even though I myself am not in the best of health."

He chose Victoria hospital because they had the shortest wait time and he needed assistance fast. They claimed there was nothing alarming from his X-ray, blood, or pee. After giving him pain medication + a muscle relaxer shot they determined his abdomen must’ve been strained from working out.

At 6 pm the pain got worse and I called for an ambulance that brought him back to Victoria hospital. After several hours of waiting in the room and only being given T3’s + another shot they discharged him saying he would be okay and that he should just relax at home. They explained if it was really serious he wouldn’t be responsive to the pain medication. This was frustrating to hear because his family and I knew there was something else wrong.

Once he got home he was unable to eat or drink without experiencing immediate pain/bloating and was vomiting constantly. He was extremely restless and FOR A THIRD TIME admitted himself into a hospital-- this time at Seven Oaks. They did the CT scan that Victoria hospital thought wasn’t necessary and found out he has a bowel obstruction. He is currently waiting for his covid test results, so that he can be rushed into surgery at Grace hospital.

I don’t know what else to say except trust your gut and keep asking for help even if they think nothing is wrong. I don’t know what could’ve happened to him if he chose to listen to Victoria hospitals advice and just tried to relax at home. This was a horrible experience for my boyfriend and unfortunately a review like mine won’t stop it from happening again."
