The experience was dehumanizing,there was no mercy. it felt like the name “emergency” was just for show.  In fact I have never seen such a lack of urgency in an emergency room . Emergency is doing a manual operation without waiting we came  to the emergency and waited 11 hours ‏But in reality,the emergency rule is not waiting.
What surprised me the most was the lack of differentiation between patients based on the severity of their conditions. Some of the patients were in serious condition, that they were told to wait Critical patients should not be made to wait, I even witnessed patients whose conditions had seemed life-threatening, and I had genuinely feared for their lives. It was mentally traumatic for me.I haven't forgotten this situation for a while. they should prioritize providing care to everyone efficiently. The hospital needs more personnel and should focus on improving the quality of care.
Hoping for a positive change!"

From the moment we arrived for the delivery, the staff made us feel supported, safe, and well cared for. Our baby’s birth was smooth, and we were so grateful for the professional and compassionate team that ensured everything went perfectly.

However, what truly impressed us was the hospital’s response when after 2 months, our infant contracted COVID-19. The doctors and nurses acted swiftly, with incredible attention to detail, and provided urgent and thorough care to ensure our baby’s recovery. Their prompt action, combined with their unwavering dedication, made all the difference.

Throughout our stay, we felt that our baby’s well-being was their top priority. The entire team— from the pediatrician to the nursing staff— went above and beyond to support both our baby’s health and our peace of mind. I will forever be grateful for the love and care they provided during such a crucial time in our lives. Thank you to everyone at Surrey memorial for your incredible professionalism and kindness."

If I could give this hospital negative stars, I would. We came  to the emergency and waited 10+ hours. When we asked the staff, how much longer, they can’t say how long and could only say “a few more hours” which probably means another 4 more hours. There were other people asking each other how long they’ve been waiting as they were also waiting a ridiculous amount of time. Some people had burn marks that needed attention. I know hospitals are busy but waiting this long and not being close to seeing the doctor is just unethical. Did they expect us to stay overnight without a proper bed?! We were still sitting in the lineup after 10+ hours. Hospitals should not operated this way. They were taking patients in so SLOWLY it was ridiculous. The staff did not even look busy. I don’t know what happened today, why the wait time was insane, but this needs to change. So many people were thinking of going home without seeing the doctor. We went home without seeing the doctor."

There’s no backup staff, and doctors take leave whenever they please. The staff lacks basic communication skills and shows no concern for the urgency of your situation. They simply dismiss you by saying, “You’ve only been here for 8 hours; others have been waiting for 10.” It’s disappointing and shameful behavior from both the staff and doctors at Surrey Memorial."

They only have one doctor—are you kidding me? I had to wait over 9 hours, and it seems no one cares about patients’ illnesses or emergencies. This hospital should shut down its emergency services entirely. People are waiting in long lines, and it’s heartbreaking to see how unproductive this place is. The government should seriously consider closing it down.

It’s absurd that critically ill patients have to wait such long hours just to see a doctor. After 8 hours, a nurse finally gave us a room, but when I left the wheelchair outside for a moment, another nurse or assistant came and took it. Even though I explained I still needed it after the doctor’s check-up, he insisted, saying other patients might need it and that I could get another wheelchair from the front desk. He just took the wheelchair and left.

After that, I stayed in the room for another hour, but the doctor still didn’t show up. This is the most ridiculous experience I’ve ever had in a hospital."

The level of care provided was far from what is expected in such a crucial department. The nurses were incredibly rude, and there seemed to be no sense of urgency or compassion for patients in severe pain. Shockingly, they did not even have sufficient beds for women in labor, leaving expectant mothers to suffer unnecessarily.

The lack of initiative from the nursing staff was alarming. Despite the obvious distress of patients, not a single nurse stepped up to offer the help and care that was desperately needed. To make matters worse, the receptionist seemed more interested in her phone than addressing the needs of patients.

It was hard to believe I was in a hospital, let alone one in a developed country. The attitude of the staff was unbearable, and they lacked both the skill and the empathy required to provide proper care. Nurses in my home country would be appalled at the lack of professionalism and humanity on display here.

In every aspect, Surrey Memorial Hospital fell short of what should be basic standards of healthcare. This is not a place I would trust for such an important and vulnerable moment as childbirth. They need to seriously rethink their approach and put patients first, rather than their attitudes!"

I have waited hours upon hours a few times in emergency waiting to see a doctor while others who just came in and who don't look in any worse shape than I do get looked after first. But I was just released yesterday early in the evening after have cancer bladder surgery. I got the surgery in record time and my medical and nurse team treated me with the utmost respect and empathy for my condition. They took extremely good care of me. Professional and Empathic all the way. This hospital is chronically short staffed and it is not because they want to be. We all know our provincial government needs to do more for our health care providers! They get 5 stars from me and I am very grateful to the doctors and nurses that worked on me. Thank you SMH!

All my life growing up, I have had 4 family members submitted here. My great grandmother at the age of 11, my great grandfather at the age of 17, my grandmother at 21, and currently my grandfather at 25. This hospital is a curse upon my family. Every time I heard that my family members were submitted into health care, my heart drops when I ask where they are, and find out it's here. Every time any of my family has been submitted there has ALWAYS been issues. Delays in exchanging them between rooms literally in hallways dying not in privacy, delays in getting the care they need, uncleanness, and miscommunication between staff. Taking an extremely long time for anything to get done. When my grandfather is suffering and we want him to be moved and not stuck in the hallway dying it doesn't seem like some staff are urgently taking action I could be wrong though. My grandfather requires a breathing mask and we were asked to bring it from home. We did and left to go get lunch. We came back, and pieces were taken off and missing and we asked where they went and they had no idea. Like, he literally can't breathe at night without it, you would THINK that it would be handled with more care. It's a 500$ mask for crying out loud it's nothing to scoff at. When he also fell and broke his hip he got surgery from here which was successful to their credit. However afterwards after a long recovery they were moving him and doing so that wasn't accommodating towards his hip injury. They had no idea he had a hip injury and treated him like he could handle it. To be fair there are some nice staff there not everyone is bad. I could only imagine how hard it is to be working in the medical field and places can get busy. Some of the managers I heard from genuinely care, not to mention there's literally a shortage of doctors and nurses in BC I don't envy their job at all and it takes a strong person to do what they do. However, If I could help it, I would never have my family members submitted here by choice. Maybe it's just bad luck for me and them, but they deserve better. No one should be suffering and dying publicly not just my family but others as well. Even if things do improve here, there's too much bad omens and memories have been inflicted upon me here to give them a chance intentionally."

Initially, the treatment I received was commendable; the staff was professional and attentive. However, the situation deteriorated significantly.

Once the initial issue was addressed. Despite being diagnosed and treated, they continued to hold me as if I were a test subject and refused to discharge me. There was no social worker available to discuss my concerns or help with the situation.

When nurses did eventually come by, their behavior was rude and dismissive. They refused to provide a prescription unless I committed to staying longer, and they were more focused on whether I was leaving rather than addressing my needs or concerns. Overall, the decline in care and professionalism after the initial treatment left much to be desired.

Okay new update next Day,   I was hold up in Hospital by Dr saying they need to check something for which i already know i have this problem. Now i came to know that Dr wouldn’t be on duty for next 1 week.

Now next day the new Dr. Hold be again for the same reason.

This is the ""breakfast/lunch/dinner"" they have been giving to an 80+ year old lady consistently EVERYDAY.

- A yogurt cup
- 1/2 cup apple juice
- Hot water with a tea bag

Never changed her bedding for 1 week until asked.

Is this the care provided to seniors?

Their washrooms have pee scattered on the floors for days, not cleaned for days, and stinks.

Liquid stains on hospital floors. The janitors come and clean only common areas and not the patients.

- Patients used Band Aids lying on floors

- Liquid stains on chairs, never cleaned.

- Rude staff.

- No clarities from doctors on patients' status.

- Broken & empty sanitizer machines.

A SHAME in Canada, our beloved country known for world-class medical facilities!

Further to it, the funny part of it is  that all the responses here in these Google reviews by the hospital are copied and pasted.

No doubt they have extremely low ratings of only 2.2."

And yet you had no heart ❤️ to measure my knee to your satisfaction it is wrong to treat another human like this ?? so what I learned the hard way today Is that if you have physio coming in to assay you please for god sake have a witness with you, so you do not get set-up like I did.

In the 12 days here waiting for a procedure to be done I have been moved 7 different times (yes, my bed has been in 7 different places in this hospital). Was told I was suppose to get a private room or semi private at the least because of my cancer, but I've been shoved into medical overflow with 10 different people, into a cubbyhole in a room that was barely able to fit my bed, and now currently in a hallway. Each time I'm told I'm going to get the private room and it's only for a day or 2. Isn't looking likely at all. And this procedure kept getting delayed and also delayed a chemo treatment for me.

However, this place only gets 3 stars from me because, while I did eventually get what I needed from them, the person who answered my call before my call with Manjot told me to wait for 48 hours after I passed on my health-related info. They did not contact me within 48 hours. They did contact me within 72 hours, although it would've been nice if they actually met the deadline which they set themselves. Manjot provided me with some helpful information on what to do, since I wanted a referral in psychiatry but it turns out they couldn't help me in that department. However during my call with her, she did a good job in conducting an assessment with me; she asked a lot of questions pertaining to my health and history, chose to be specific with some questions and didn't push if I didn't feel comfortable, and also did a good job in making me feel safe, even if it was on phone.

What concerns me though is the many other reviews that rated this place lower than I did. For me the service was satisfactory, however since my request was just to figure out what the heck is going on with me mentally (wanted a diagnosis and I'm mentally not well right now but it's not nearly as urgent as others), I can't speak for the many other people who actually need immediate, urgent care. My advice is, if you need something from these guys that doesn't require immediate care, depending on what it is, you'll eventually get it. But if it's urgent... I'd say read the other reviews and decide for yourself."

I would like to thank Nurses Chelsea, Diana and Jessica for providing care for my wife in labour. Also Dr. Pinksky for delivering our baby. Our nurses and doctors leading up to the birth were great and provided good care.

There were many things that happened in our experience which would lead us to think twice about having another child here. Its understandable that it is a busy hospital but parts of our experience really were quite negative.

1. One of the nurses made a mistake on the medication provided, which she thought my wife was not allowed to eat while on the medication to help with contractions.
2. Some of the nurses were quite rude to each other. This was really bad.
3. My wife's meals were forgotten several times! This was quite a disapointment as she had nearly a 40 hour labour.
4. The Anesthesiologist bed side manner was horrendous.
4. The care after having your child was virtually non-existent. Some of the nurses would check in with how you were doing just to check the box. They did not seem to care. Also the nurses afterwards would repeatedly interupt my wife from sleep and my baby. This was very frustrating as she and our baby needed rest to recover.
5. The aftercare nurses did not help at all with breast feeding, some of them did not seem to know what they were. The nurses and doctors were negligent that our child had a bad tongue tie.

If you have to deliver your baby at SMH, look at all your options. Do your research. Consider a Midwife, or get a Doula for care for after the birth, as the care after birthing is non existent at SMH. Stay far away from this place if you can!!"

Few times I took family members who were admitted to mental health unit and had to advocate for them (since they couldn't talk for themselves at that time), had to remind the staff members of what medications had caused severe reactions. You would think that the mental health team would appreciate a family member's input since the family members would be the best advocate for the patient, second to the patient. I have found the mental health team members to be quite arrogant and sometimes rude; they don't want you to ask them questions, they believe that they are the experts and that's it. I guess they are not very aware of the mental health act, it's not what they say is the rule of law, patients have rights.  If the mental health team really CARE about the patients and their well-being they would involve the family members in care, they would appreciate family members input.  Just imagine if the mental health team in hospitals care enough to involve caring family members perhaps we wouldn't be having issues like what is happening downtown Surrey, Langley and Vancouver. Unfortunately these are individuals who had no one to speak on their behalf. These mental health team members at Surrey memorial ( PAU) need to re-educate themselves about dealing with people if they don't feel that they are not stable to work in such an environment please don't, there are plenty departments in the hospital they can go work in.  Only people who are capable being MINDFUL should work in mental health. I was extremely upset today when  I called at PAU to ask about my family member, just because I ask for the nurse to clarify what she was saying, she passed the phone to her colleague because she said I was being rude to her not knowing I heard what she was saying while handed the phone over. Just the way she talked to me made me feel very CONCERNED for the safety of my family member who is currently at PAU.  I just found out from my family member that they were given a medication that their community psychiatrist knows causes severe reaction, wouldn't that information be on the patient 's file?? What is going on?? Does the mental health team at Surrey memorial consider the patients as human beings? I should not  be having anxiety because I brought my family member to the hospital for treatment.  Hospitals are supposed to be safe environment??? I would hate to think that I or my  family member is being treated a certain way because of our cultural background. By the way the nurse at PAU talk to me , I am really having second thoughts about leaving my family members at Surrey memorial. Would they be treated fairly?

Doctors please care enough to investigate carefully ask questions and most of all please be mindful. Nurses need to practice being MINDFUL also."

I even told her that i won’t like to waste their time as i was already over 15 mins late. But as per their policy if we arrive late over 15 minutes we have to reschedule our appointment, so I asked her for rescheduling it instead. She seemed she did not wanted to be help me and sounded bit racist !!! I was just asking for a reschedule but she kept on increasing her tone and saying how I am irresponsible, even though I said sorry and just asked for reschedule right after 15 mins of spare time!! If you guys can be little more gentle and nice to your patients it will really help other clients who are coming from far away ! Just be nice, life is too short !"

I was put from 1 room to another and another and was asked to sit on a chair where there are several treatment rooms available. I was with 4 other patients in a treatment room for 5+ hours where nobody checked on us. I went to the nurses station to ask if someone is coming to see us. 4 staff - 3 younger ones where hanging out chatting and laughing at the nurses station, the other one walked away when she saw me approaching. That was very insulting and inconsiderate to us. They better change their careers or better yet review and understand their oath.

More so, it is the hospital system they need to re-evaluate. What is the use of having modern facilities but with a lousy staff. I understand the scarcity of doctors in ""Canada"" in general (paging Health Ministry- how do you address that? ) yet there are inconsiderate and lazy nurses hanging around laughing out loud while there are patients who are suffering in pain waiting for their care and compassion. What a shame!

In reality, there are a lot of medical doctors living here in Canada whom I believed more experienced and can do the job better yet our government because of Canadian standard they can't practice for gazillion of reasons. So how can this issue be reconciled?
Think. Think harder. Paging people who sits in the gov't.

Seriously, SMH needs new ER system.

My 2 stars are for the lab assistant who took my bloodworks and 1 Filipina staff who followed up on Treatment 14 room.

Hire more Filipinas and Filipinos who are warm and compassionate. Always wears a smile on their face. It helps alleviate the pains and sufferrings of the patients."

Peds are pretty good ive never spent more than 2-3hrs with my little guy and weve been about 3 times recently (toddlers are terrifying) honestly cant complain much about peds the staff are all super kind to the kiddos.

The main emergency department however is absolutely horrible, i honestly with is could review the 2 separately. The main ED is overflowing constantly, it can take hours for a simple x-ray, i saw a woman coughing up blood there once and she was still waiting for 5+hrs. They also have patients who test positive for covid mixed into the waiting room with nothing but a mask from home (usually cloth) They are short staffed i will give them that but if they had a separate section for homeless and drug users (2 very large problems in that area) then the ed would run a lot smoother. Overall if you arent in a state of life or death i would suggest the drive to a slightly further hospital (delta and peace arch arent too far and much less busy about 30-45mins each)"

And I am not writing this review just because of my own personal bad experience, but also due to several other bad experiences which my known ones faced during several visits. I would respectfully request everyone, if you have some condition, where you need medical assistance, try and find some other way to treat yourself, rather than going to this hospital."

I told them multiple times not to give me an anti psychotic because I have bad reactions to them
They gave it to me anyway and lo and behold I had a bad reaction

If you need psych help, go literally anywhere else. Even Langley was better and that was rough."

Thank you so very much for all you do everyday and all the negativity you have to put up with.
I came in for an abscess that was very painful and got the best care. I waited 11 hrs to see a doctor but I’m ok with that because I’m greatful to not be a critical patient or have something life threatening.
While waiting I saw way too many people being super rude to support staff and nurses and complaining about wait times. We all get triaged for a reason so the critical cases get the care first! So many people don’t understand this. I know many people are in pain, tired, feel sick, worried but that doesn’t mean you treat others with disrespect. We are all waiting a long time because we are stable and there are many that are not and because of a high volume of people coming in. It takes time to treat everyone and make sure they get what they need.
This particular night was a Friday and it was fully packed in every waiting room I was in. The nurses I saw that did my vitals on arrival, checked me in, took my blood, and did another vitals check later on were amazing and super kind. I was given Tylenol and Advil for the pain which really helped!
My mom had to leave at one point and couldn’t find her car and a security guard was so kind and helped her find it, thank you so much!
The  doctor I saw was excellent, very thorough, compassionate, and gentle. She gave me really good advice to take care of my healing at home and I am on the mend now.

During my last visit for a burnt hand, I initially refused treatment on account of delay and mental distress, prompting them to call security. Four individuals responded, one woman in a white short sleeve shirt and the rest 3 were men in a different uniform. Notably, the woman stood out as strong and literate and was possibly of brown ethnicity. Despite being coerced into treatment against my initial refusal, she empathetically acknowledged my pain and concerns. I don't know her name, but her compassionate approach played a pivotal role in changing my mind. My sincere appreciation goes to her for exemplifying a humane attitude, fostering a patient-centric approach that goes beyond mere enforcement. It’s only because of her that I am leaving a five star review for this institution."

Couldn’t stand the truth about the garbage hole that is Surrey Memorial Hospital. Well here is repost. See how long this stays up.
I guess the best way to approach this would be to say that Surrey Memorial Hospital could quite possibly be the worst hospital in the world. And possibly have the worst doctors and nurses working in any hospital in the world.
These so called doctors and nurses think they are immune to their being held accountable and in my case they probably won't be because I'll be dead before they can be brought to Justice in a court of law. But make no mistake in my opinion they have destroyed human life simply because they are inept and do not deserve to practice medicine anywhere in the world. But of course that doesn't matter in British Columbia. It seems that any doctor will do in this province.
If this were a movie I would suggest that they should be tried as murderers. But since this is not a movie I can't say that. Because that would upset there Poor little egos and make them sad.
But of course turning me into a quadriplegic I'm sure was just fun and part of their daily humour.
See you in court if I live that long. If I do live that long there are 12 doctors that I will demand that their licenses be revoked and their pensions be suspended and that they never practice another day of medicine in their life. See if you have the guts to leave this review up."

Aside from the fact that I was never even fed until we bought food, they then proceeded to tell me what was my fault and ""they didn't know"", despite telling multiple nurses previously. They refused to bring any late tray, stating that ""lunch time is over and you can wait for dinner"". Keeping in mind that I had been admitted since 8am and never got breakfast or lunch.

Speaking of being admitted. We phoned in early, left a little bit after. On the call they instructed us to come in and we'd be immediately ready to go when we arrived. However this was not the case when we arrived, 3 hours after the call. They were not prepared and we ended up waiting an extra 2 hours to be admitted because they ""didn't have a chart"" for me. They think they're talking quietly amongst eachother but we can hear everything that's being said, which is how we knew that issue has arose.

After this, and multiple other issues that are piling on, that can see that I'm obviously distressed.  When trying to have skin to skin moments, they told me to put my baby down because ""that's how you get clingy spoiled babies"". They also insisted that I could not breastfeed and instead told me to give up and forced us to use formula. This is a hospital that doesn't provide any nurturing care, they provide just barely enough care to even call it a hospital. During this time as well, the same nurse was absolutely sassy and had no place to say many things that she did. One of them being ""Of course your husband wouldn't write it down"", basically implying that he couldn't be responsible with babies simply because she never gave us a pen to fill in the feeding chart. She didn't have to be so disgustingly rude about it. Especially to say these things behind his back, while he was getting us prepared to leave.

Only one single night nurse was extremely helpful. She brought an extra dinner tray, as well she also was a lot more encouraging than anybody else for the entire time.  She insisted that the nurse, that I had spoken to,  was in the wrong and helped validate the concerns I had. She insisted she could help if we knew who the other nurse was, but unfortunately these nurses think it's appropriate to not wear their name tags. I assume that this is so that way they can make ill informed choices and decisions for their patients, without repercussions. Sadly, that's about the only positive thing that happened during the stay.

They nurses are so over the top with their lack of safety that they insisted they had to see the carseat we have (not a bucket, so it's super heavy), which led to another fight. So we had to wheelchair a carseat in and out, which was absolutely ridiculous as they are not trained to check car seats. their ""check"" could've been done with photos, as they only ""need"" to see the expiration dates and such. Which I say ""need"" in quotes because they didn't even look for it. They forced us to bring up a 40lbs car seat just so they could say ""we can't find the stickers"" and to confirm with us the year that we got our seat. During the car seat check they also decided to ""fix"" our tightness of the belts because ""we don't want it to choke your baby"". This was an ill-informed.comment, as it's impossible to choke a child with a carseat, when done correctly. Instead they loosened my baby's belts an extra 2 inches, leaving the baby in a compromised position incase of an accident. This is a small baby and she would have went FLYING out of the seat, if I did not retighten the belts after we left.

Overall this was the worst possible birthing experience I have ever had in my life. However, I didn't get a choice of hospital. If you get one, run away from SMH."

This hospital is the most shortstaffed hospital in BC. Having said that, I think there is a certain level of lack of transparency, and even corruption, at all levels, that has allowed some of the worst healthcare providers to stay employed, IN SPITE OF, and not because of the shortage of healthcare workers. There is no amount of news coverage that would convince me, that the 2 receptionists at the ER reception, sitting idly and comfortably in their chairs, and a few nurses and various staff (certain ones, not all - some are very dutiful) gossiping and randomly taking very leisurely breaks tucked away behind the safety of the reception table inside the ER room, are part of this ""overwhelming"" demand on the hospital staff. To those whose who are giving it their all - I commend you. To those who think they deserve to put down the suffering of others because they despise their career choice - we are not sorry, as it isn't our fault your career path isn't working out the way you wanted.

I was a 9/10 for pain. I had a full bladder for 2 hours prior to coming to the ER. I waited another 6 hours. I almost passed out from the pain. The ER reception decided that I was low priority because of a preexisting mental health condition, and either thought that I was faking the pain, or was displeased by the scene that I was making (on account of the fact that I was writhing on the floor in pain). They called maybe 7 or 8 people, who were robust and agile on their feet, and who came in after me. When I ended up inside, I just saw a general ER doctor -as I found out later from the staff- and not a specialist, which would have justified the delaying of my visit. This ""triage"" definitely was not working. Another 2 hours with a full bladder, and I would have suffered irreversible damage and potentially death.

I am forever thankful to the doctor and nurses who treated me with grace and kindness inside the ER(I give them infinite stars separately as individuals). There were a few nurses that definitely belittled me and others like myself, but I pity them, as they hate their lives way more than I hated mine on that day that I spent in that hospital.

I stand by my 1 star rating for the hospital ER as the reception is critical to the overall functioning of the ER. I would give more stars if this was just some family physicians clinic with a bad reception, but this is the Emergemcy Room. Even the housekeeping staff showed a great deal of empathy, which was the opposite of what the reception had - a hatred for their jobs, and a disgust for how little the average patient's taxes contributed towards their income, compared to what must have amounted to the most insurmountable personal sacrifice they had to have to made for the average patient.

There were some wonderful staff who worked on the inside, but the hospital is completely broken if the ER reception is lacking in empathy, altruism and morality, as every step is crucial in case of a real emergency. This is a disaster waiting to happen. What if someone dies on their hands because of their disrespect for human suffering? Will they review their conduct then?

Individuals who do not respect human life, do not deserve to work in the healthcare industry. Regardless of how much of a favor you think you are doing the sick and misfortunate, remember it is a blessing to have secure employment, and it is not your God given right. Just because there is high demand for healthcare workers, does not mean there always will.

Shame on the staff who put our lives at risk. There is very little that an average sick individual at the mercy of the ER can do after the injustice, but those who toy with lives will remember their own shame."

Found out I have internal bleeding. The hospital suggested me to a clinic rather than getting started on the problem. I can die from this. Today is my 5th day, and nobody even talked to me when I walked into the hospital. They are under staffed. And the ones working are not properly putting patients through.

This is dramatically horrible.

Nobody should have to wait as long 2 hours just to be checked in.. yet alone the 14 hour wait I had last time to see a doctor just for him to tell me to go elsewhere and that recommendation waisted a week of my time.

this morning I’m vomiting because it continues to get worse and I’m still yet to hear anything in regards to actions to be taken for this to be fixed.

I have pictures of a baby wipe that was used to clean the floor In front of my dad .  The cleaners are using filthy cleaning pads on their mops.
Doctors and nurses don’t read past files on patients instead they’re having a good time socializing about their weekend.

I am actually embarrassed as a Canadian that a facility like this can operate this way and have the staff behind the desk be so rude to you at the same time. Absolutely pathetic in every single possible way. When I finally decide to leave rather than wait another 7 hours they tell me I'm leaving against medical advice which is impossible because I hadn't seen a doctor to receive any medical advice. This emergency room would seriously be better off closed because they aren't helping anyone anyways so what is the point in wasting public money when you could divert it to a hospital that actually does something. Whoever is in charge of this hospital should be fired plain and simple because they are incompetent. Canadian healthcare seems to be the envy of the rest of the world but it is all smoke and mirrors.

My grandpa was in the ward 5W and was getting better as he had a bone infection in his spine. But then the poor protection of patients against covid-19 was crazy! My grandfather was just getting better and on the way to discharge but then he was hit with covid. The nurses said he was all better 3 weeks later ( this was may)

And in June my we almost lost my grandpa because he was handling coronavirus, an ammonia, a fungal bacteria in his blood AND his spine infection which caused his immune system to overload so his energy levels were very low so he was sleeping. And when I went to the hospital to go visit him he wasn’t responding to anything. I told the nurse who tried to wake him up and nothing worked till they did this reflex thing on his foot which woke him up.

I was asking the nurse to bring an emergency doctor ASAP and she brought one and as we were talking to the doctor he was saying that he was just fine he’s probably just tired LIKE WHAT??? And the nurses were SUSPICIOUSLY TAKING IV BAGS AWAY like they made a mistake on giving a med to the wrong patient.

So I went home to recieve a call at 11pm that my grandfather was in extremely bad condition and wasn’t responding to the ventilator. SOOO AT 6PM HE WAS FINE AND NOW HE ISNT?? We almost lost him that night. And the doctor said on the phone, so what should we do if LATER in the night he stops breathing? CPR, or should we let him be at rest. LIKE HELLO??? IM NOT THE DOCTOR YOU ARE!! TAKE HIM TO ICU! I swear to god I don’t even know but these doctors could be racist or something or not even be a real doctor 😒😒😒

my grandpa goes to ICU in the new ward and thank god the nurses and doctors there were SO NICE AND KIND! But the other building is like a third world country hospital !

I was shocked..first i was confused,  because they told me we not recommend you to drive a car. I was fainted couple of times today. Might be possible it can happen again. Some how I reached to hospital..my heart was pumping faster then normal.  After my blood test.mri and chest scan. they told me I'm good..there is nothing wrong with me. Today I'm still sick though 🤧... I slept 13 hours. Not feeling good."

At the ambulance, an examination with blood drawing, ultrasound, and fluorography took about 5 hours. The only minus was the waiting time for a doctor’s appointment and the slowness of the manipulations. Thank you to the doctors and nurses for helping us save our daughter."

This was not the case 7 years ago. In the ward at night, the patient was in great pain and rang the emergency bell. No one answered the rang for a long time. Fortunately, she continued to support her. If an accident happened, who would be responsible? This responsibility was because the patient was in great need of rescue at this time, but no one showed up. , the patient sent a WeChat message to her family, calling for help, and her family members came. The assistant in this unit showed a bad attitude and said she didn’t know what she needed? If you ring the emergency bell, you must need help. How can a patient survive for so long without even taking a look? ? ? It’s unbelievable! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"

No privacy in the emergency room, 30 treatment places. Not acceptable for Europeans. An extremely expensive treatment option for non-Candiers, 350CAD advance payment before seeing a doctor, otherwise 1150 CAD for a treatment, the admission procedure takes at least 1.5 hours, stay away if possible!"
