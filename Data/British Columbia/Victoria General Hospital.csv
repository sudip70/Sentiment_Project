I have a past history of Lymphoma which is why i  became very concerned. I checked in, waited 10 hours to have a Blood Test and X Ray done and another 3hrs to get the result. The first day experience was alright other than the wait time for a couple of simple operations. I was requested to come back the next day for a Ultra Sound. The Ultra Sound was what found my Lymphoma years ago. Knowing this I was concerned ,but knew it was the last test that would confirm my Cancer didn't come back. After having the Ultra Sound I was told to wait in the ER waiting room for my results by the Ultra Scan technician. I waited for 9hrs before I went to the front desk to check on my status. Only to find out I wasn't checked in and I would have to check in all over again. Horrified after patiently waiting I pleaded that I shouldn't have to wait another 9hrs. Thankfully the front check in lady listened to my concerns and took the time to back track the information to see that infact I had been there since 10:20am as requested by the Ultra Sound Technician. She apologized and said she would get me in as soon as she could, of course as long as it didn't impeed a more critical patient, which was understandable. The ER check in Nurse got me in right away and I sat in room waiting for the results of the Ultra Sound to be explained by a Doctor. That's when a Nurse came in the room, the same one that asked me about my symptoms at the ER check in the day before. She asked about my symptoms like I had never been there, horrified again thinking I just wasted almost 25hrs in the last two days to be no further ahead. About 30 mins later the doctor came in and told me the results were good and I should get it looked at again in the 3 months. I am not a doctor ,but when it only took about 20 minutes from the time my situation of not being a patient in the system to being told my Ultra Sound results were good seems very quick to be 100% the result of the Ultra Scan. I left feeling releived and with doubt ,but also horrified with with lack of organization to keep track of patients. I remember reading the sign that said wait times are as follows based on the sign for 9 out of 10 people. I wondered what the 10th person wait time would be, I guess the 10th person is the person that is forgotten about..I now know. The 2 stars are for the ER check in Nurse that worked on Dec2@9:00pm that apologized and actually carried through for me, Thank You. The 3 missing stars are for the suffering of having to sit there for 9hrs pondering the results of a test that would determine the outcome of my future."

My story:
I was brought in by ambulance 9am Friday.  I was first brought into the trauma room because my heart rate was so low.  The trauma team was AMAZING!
I stayed 5 days in the hospital.  They did a lot of tests.  I am very appreciative of that.
I, as a patient, heard a lot of things the staff was saying about my heart BUT no one communicated anything at all to me (heart failure, cardiac arrest, heart muscle death, cancer, tumor) I saw countless Drs and no one knew my medical history.  I was ignored dismissed and honestly terrified I was dying.  I asked for a shower numerous times but was told it was inconvenient.  Everything that was missed, or lost (like my signed consent form for surgery) was blamed on their “new system”
After all that on the fifth day I was literally told… there’s nothing wrong and I left the hospital feeling worse than I felt the first day. As I lay here right now my heart is tight"

First, the surgery was supposed to be an overnight stay in ICU. I would rather get a sewing needle and do it myself then to trust Dr. Fleetwood's competence. If only I took him to competent doctors that actually cared about their patients instead!

The ICU nurses do not care about your loved ones either. I visited every day and watched them stand around chit-chatting. Certainly not talking about the tasks at hand. One by one I watched the patients slowly pass away. Despite machines constantly going off, nurses rarely came in to check on  my partner. He pulled sensitive equipment out in an attempt to help himself in his confused state. He quickly went downhill, but nothing was really done to help. CT scans done over and over again with no real other steps taken to address his worsening condition.

He was only in his early forties and I'm now a widow in my late thirties. Honestly wish I never encouraged the surgery. He would have lived longer simply allowing nature to take its course. It's sickening Canadians even have to pay into this medical system. At least in the States you die because you can't afford treatment. In Canada, we die while getting taxed for inadequate care. This hospital convinced me not to bother with getting medical treatment in the future. It's too bad I can't opt out of the waste of money and keep it for loved ones to inherit.

Edit: I forgot to include the nurse who set up the appointment also contributed to his death by ignoring him when he mentioned he recently received medication for an infection. He ended up passing away from an infection. So pretty much everyone at this hospital doesn't care at all or do the barest minimum to improve survival. Again, you are better off letting nature take it's course as you will live longer."

When we were the next ones to see the doctor, some other patient came in with a gun shot wound and the doctors immediately rushed to see him. A few minutes later the police arrived and told everyone to leave as the hospital is going into lock down. I attempted speaking to staff and they ignored me and said leave immediately. I then helped not only my wife, but also some other patient who was a pregnant woman with a concussion back to my car and drove them both home.

I called the next morning asking if we were able to schedule something to see a doctor and explained the situation of how we waited the day prior and were told to leave by the police. They said there is nothing they can do for us and we have to just start the whole process again.

Unless you are unconscious and paramedics have to take you to this hospital, don't go to the ER. After making my severely injured wife wait for over 8 hours, they had no compassion to send us away and make us do the whole thing again the following day.

Oh, almost forgot to mention they had to take my wife's blood sample twice because they somehow lost the first one. I'm sure this is a very professionally run hospital with great staff, but this experience made me never want to put my wife or myself through that again."

Recently I have been very sick and have had to go in twice in 3 months. Once in an ambulance and yesterday being rushed there before my
Partner had to work.  The triage staff is usually a little cold but I really do not fault them as I arrived both times in the night and had to stay overnight in emerge and those poor intake workers were so busy both times, and they are always working. This is not always the case and if you are kind you usually get kindness back.

On my first visit it was a less chaotic night so the wait was less insane and not everyone was rushing around to ensure ease of care. I could not keep anything down and I had a panic attack (which I get fairly often and actively treat) while they were taking my blood because I kept vomiting. One nurse stayed with me and gave me breathing exercises and did them with me while the other nurse RAN to get something to help with both the panic attack but also the thing that caused the panic attack. They talked to me and also listened. The kind and friendly doctor came in after and took the time to listen, process the info and ask good and non-insulting questions.

Last night it was very busy. The triage nurses looked like they had been in a prize fight as I got there a couple hours before changeover to third shift. The nurse that did my intake was a little short with me, but she got me registered and through intake, in like 2 minutes from start to getting both bracelets slapped on you. I was there for about 8 hours last night and the staff, as stretched paper thin as they are, still kept everything very cordial and professional. The medical imaging staff on last night were so kind, and comforting. After I had the imaging done that I needed, i walked back and it was after changeover at the triage station. There was a very kind male staffer who took pity on how overwhelmed, scared, and exhausted I was and let me sleep in an empty quiet room and even sent my carers (nurse, doctor, etc…) in so that I could sleep as much as possible in between (i had been awake for well over 48 hours due to the illness). He even let me stay in that room and sleep until my ride showed up.
The resident doctor they sent in is the human embodiment of where I hope modern medicine continues to head. She was so detailed, she did not make me feel like I was playing it up. We went through everything that was happening and she spoke to me like a peer and not a child. The questions she asked were so helpful and SHE LISTENED TO ALL OF IT AND EVEN VALIDATED WHAT I WAS FEELING. She did everything in her power to help me and that woman is still in her residency!

The only deduction I am giving is because BC hospitals are incredibly short staffed and I think that part of the reason is that these people, who have dedicated their adult lives to helping others, are being asked to build a mansion with duct tape and desperation, with a third of the crew they would need to complete that task under the best of circumstances. VIHA and the BC ministry of health need to take a look and allocate more public funding for these hospital workers and hey, maybe use some of that as tuition money/scholarships for people who can barely afford to stay clothed and fed but would thrive in medical."

In order to write this review of Victoria General Hospital (VGH); I have chosen to write it in sections as it applied to me during my stay.
I arrived at the hospital 15 minutes prior to my admission time. Was directed to the day surgery ward where unfortunately there was incorrect information submitted on my personal health information record from another hospital. Although this mis-information did not lead to my missing my surgery it did cause the admitting staff to take extra precautions. Although I repeatedly told the staff that the information was incorrect; they kept the precautions “in place” until the error was corrected. I was told that patient and staff safety was paramount and seeing how the staff reacted to this mis-information and was totally respectful towards me; that in itself showed me that pre-admission staff are very well trained in their responsibilities and took their work very seriously.
I am especially grateful to both anesthesiologists who spent time with me prior to my surgery.  Both tried to convince me to take a spinal freeze instead of an anesthetic because of breathing issues. However, I was steadfast in wanting to have my surgery done whilst I was under a general anesthetic. Thank you ever so much Doctors for preventing me from “going to the light”.  People say it wasn’t your time; I say it was because of the skill and knowledge of both doctors that I am still alive.
After surgery one enters a PACU-Primary ward that was once called the Recovery ward. In the Victoria General Hospital here is where all the nurse “angels” work. Never in my entire life have I ever seen a more “patient care” dedicated workforce then in this ward. The nurses know their job; do their job without compliant or oversight; engage with each patient as if they are family members and give the care that we all hope to receive.
These nurses do not gather in groups to talk amongst themselves about outside or weekend activities; these nurses are there to do a job and boy do they do it well. My nurse was a petit European lady with blonde hair and she provided me with the comfort and care that is unheard of in today’s hospitals; and from what I observed every other patient was getting similar treatment from their nurse as I was. If only every ward had nurses that had the ambition, the knowledge and the dedication that these nurses have; for if that were the case, most of out medical issues would disappear.
The staffing on floor South 7 were again very responsive to the patients needs and provided better bedside care then I have witnessed in most hospitals. I am again grateful to that staff for assisting me through my recovery.
Overall – this hospital and the departments I engaged with deserve an A for a job well done. However, the PACU Primary staff on the evening of April 24th between the hours of 4 and 8 pm deserves the A+ award. There are none better that these nurses.
This hospital and staff have to be considered as one of the top medical treatment centres on Vancouver Island."

We had a stay of 19 hours in the hospital emergency area. In that time she had a blood test, Ultrasound, a doctor visit, and the needed medication in the one visit. It was time well spent in the hospital. We were relived it was not series. (It was far better then wasting time at a medical clinic for a 5 minute visit with a doctor, that yield no results).

Dr Jones treated me and set me up an appointment with an eye specialist. The specialist sent me for a 4:00 appointment with a retina specialist and the next day I had lazar surgery. Had it not been for the referral to the eye specialist, my retina would have probably detached and I could have lost some sight in the eye. There is an incredible  amount of professionalism at VGH and I can't thank you enough.

This a new review from three months ago. I had spinal stenosis surgery on February 7th, 2022. The nursing and other staff went beyond in post op care. First, I was fortunate enough to have a private room.

The ward was overcrowded and the nurses were overworked but they and the Care aids were amazing. They washed me and got me up walking the first day. They were very kind and efficient. I felt well cared for. All the nurses were encouraging. They had their masks on the entire time I was there. I loved their dry sense of humour as well.

Dr. Hentschel did a great job of the surgery but I have a separate review on his website.

The anaesthetist was very kind and caring and so were the nurses before and in the OR.

OT and Physio secured a walker for me the next day and arranged for all my equipment to be picked up upon my release and an appointment with aftercare.

I had a very good experience all around and felt well taken care of. Thank you.

I had a gallstone/gall bladder surgery in November 2023. I was supposed to stay overnight. No one could inform me as to whether the gall bladder had been removed with my gallstones. My physician had left it in my file. No one knew if I was supposed to leave the next morning. A doctor finally signed the release form.

I did not need much care. The other three patients, all gall bladder patients, needed more care. The nurse apologized that she had not got to me. I felt sorry for the nurse as she was definitely run off her feet. Later, my surgeon told me that the hospital is supposed to have 7 nurses on duty but they are down to 3 the last couple years on most wards.

I have never experienced such a horrible pharmacy. I have a number of medications. I sent the complete list with dosage times etc. I did not receive my meds on time. They forgot several of my meds and the proper times and amount of dosage. When the nurse came with them , I pointed out the incorrectness. I told her that I carry my meds and just to get rid of the incorrect ones they sent. The nurse told me this was not a new experience. The pharmacy made mistakes like this all the time. Note: that did not happen when I was in for spinal stenosis surgery 18 months ago.

My sister worked at the hospital as a pharmacist until a couple years ago. Pharmacists earn between $11000. to $125000. a year. It must be nice to have a job where you can earn that and not have to do your job correctly.

Note:
Please take your medications with you if you are staying overnight as this inefficient department will not not give you the proper medications and dosage times."

The nurses were kind although at times very curt in their response.  The problem in this hospital ER is the triage  system.  I sat for approximately  6 hours in the waiting room so l saw a lot of patients come and go.  And l realize that people in the waiting room have no idea of the status of people being brought in by ambulance who may need immediate  attention.  However when you have been sitting for hours and you see someone come in with a cough and they only have to wait about an hour, are seen and were given a rx.  There is something wrong.  People were getting angry and upset, security had to be called several times.  People were left sitting to watch other people who arrived after them receiving treatment and leaving.  Lots of people waited for hours and then gave up and left.  I was at the emergency  department for a total of 12 hours, l saw the doctor, received something  for pain and had an ultra sound.  When it was suggested that l have a cat scan which would mean more hours waiting l told the doctor l was exhausted, hadn't any sleep and all l wanted to do was go home.  I can't imagine what it's like to work in emergency,  l can't imagine how many sick people give up, go home and only end up sicker.  I blame the government for this situation, they underpaid family doctors until they gave up their practices.  Now their patients flow like a river into emergency departments.  The system isn't broken, there isn't any kind of system at all."

Was told 1 parent could be in room during operation. Was told they would give sedative medication prior to mask to be put to sleep. At OR was told parent could not be in room with child. Tried to explain this and security was called. They did not give sedative prior to mask and forcefully applied gas until she was knocked out. Very traumatizing experience mostly for my 5 yr old but the whole family in general. Lied about procedures twice. Child now traumatized of medical procedures.

I would rather die at home and I think the ER staff would happily agree to me doing that. HORRIBLE people work there."

If your problem isn’t life threatening  most likely they’ll run out of space and not have any doctors that can see you anyways.
I’ve never had a problem with VGH when my appointments are scheduled but their ER needs help, and they have patients who need their help that they’re not taking care of. I have no access to my results, and found out the reason I’m not able to see a doctor is because they’re waiting for more to come in.
It’s extremely frustrating when you’re in pain and forced to sit on a shopping cart turned into wheelchair with only a blanket for comfort to sit on and a push bar that stabs your bad if you even think of leaning backward. No medication to control pain because it’s not allowed in the waiting room, and nurses who don’t even look at you when they walk by.
I haven’t been able to sleep because of this stupid wheelchair, I’m in pain because I don’t know if my ankle is fractured or dislocated, and frankly I just want to pack myself up and and chalk up the past 8 hours as a joke and go home.

At least with an urgent care clinic you get to see the doctor. if you’re not bleeding out, cut your losses and go to an urgent care clinic. At least it feels like they’re trying to help you there."

I had the staff disobey doctor's order's when I was a patient there following an accident..... and almost immediately they heard me screaming I pain after I fell badly.  So they had to pick up my body off the ground and listen to me cry out in pain and frustration when they refused to listen to me about the fact that my shoulder was broken! I'm a nurse - yet they refused to believe that their negligence could be at fault. it took 3 weeks before they agreed to the x-ray and yes, it was broken but unfortunately by then, since there had been no treatment for so long, it had become a 'frozen shoulder'. So I had to endure 20 months of 3-5 times a week in physiotherapy before I had physical control of my arm again!!!

This hospital is full of unskilled, unintelligent staff that care more about their smoke breaks than following vital orders from doctors about patient care! Go to ANY OTHER HOSPITAL if you want adequate care."

Unlike others here, I have had good interactions with staff, and had a great female Doctor who's name I wish I had remembered - but good/bad staff members are everywhere so I am not writing about that. It's the waiting times that are beyond acceptable.

Been in there a few times. Father was in there today. Dehydration on both accounts for separate reasons. I had to wait a total of seven hours just to be seen by a doctor,  and finally left at 4:30pm.

Today, I drove in my father who was sick and pretty badly dehydrated. We arrived around 7:40am. It is currently 1:25pm and he has still not seen a Dr, let alone received any kind of treatment.

It only takes an hour to treat this. Could have been in and out of everyone's hair well before mid-morning. Yes, I understand there is a triage in place, and however it's being managed is clearly not working as I am not the only person writing a review about the horrid waiting times.

Friends in Europe are appalled to hear this, saying it would have made news to have such ridiculous wait periods. I tell them it's just another day here in Canada and our so called great healthcare.

The way things are going right now, he will have been sitting there dehydrated in a room filled with other unfortunate people, lucky to be out of the hospital by 5pm. Likely ten hours ... just to see a Dr. and receive a simple IV fluid.

Pathetic."

She asked him to come back the next day if symptoms got worse, and that he wouldn't have to wait. Symptoms got worse, he went in and checked in with staff who could not have cared less about the Drs request for him to go in straight away for an IV. Made him wait 2 hours.

I flew home that night and went directly to the hospital. Although it was way past visiting hours, I was greeted with kindness and immediately updated on dad's condition. Unfortunately the news was not good and given his age, the only thing that could be done was to keep him comfortable. The staff arranged for a place for mom so she can stay the night with dad. The next day, he was moved to a private room to give us privacy to say our goodbyes.
Despite the nurse & doctor shortages (which is not their fault), everyone was very compassionate, caring and took the time to explain to us exactly what to expect. He passed away on the 14th and again, the staff reached out to us to insure that we were supported in our grief.
I've always had positive experiences at this hospital and I am very grateful to everyone.

The staff were so kind and understanding. I was really really nervous and the nurse took extra time to come and sit with me and answer my questions and calm me down and I can't imagine what it would have been like if she hadn't done that. The porter who brought me into the OR was cheerful and anesthetist was very understanding of my anxiety and get me something right away to help calm me down. When I came round there was a nurse there with water and she stayed with me the whole time. I was very very pleasantly surprised at how easy the whole experience was and would like to say a big thank you to everyone who contributed to it!

It was Feb 12, 2017. Around 10AM, I guess.
I lost my 10 month old little baby girl at the time.
My baby was surrounded with doctors and nurses at General Hospital Emergency Room.
When I realized that my baby couldn't come back in my arms, I was sobbing and mourning with my wife at the corner of the room which was assigned for my family.
All of a sudden, an old lady staff rushed into the room, and she saw us tortured(there was obvious eye-contact between us).
But she didn't stop talking and laughing loudly several minutes, and left.

As an immigrant, I still wonder how such a thing would've happened in the hospital. I don't want to believe that 'joking around and being excited before someone else's death' is Canadian culture, or the hospital staff was kind of inconsiderate? I will never forget that face of the staff till the end of my life..."

UPDATE: Took it up with the Patient Care Quality Office.  They called me back and said a manager would get back to me within 5 days.  It has been over 2 week and no call.  They say they care about patients.  This is just the spin.  They couldn't care less!!!!

After a half hour of her being ignored I am very concerned and go to the desk.
Everyone’s body language is “don’t bother me”
Through all of what I am about to write I am polite, speak with a low voice, begin every statement with “please” and end with “thank you’.

I explain to the staff member that I am concerned about My wife as she could be having a heart attack and I learned in CPR that the heart will die if not attended to immediately.  I explain I am worried.  They say she had an EKG and if it were urgent she would have been seen and she is “in the cue”.

I ask My wife if she had an EKG and she said no.

I am still very concerned, so I go back to triage and ask if I can speak to someone else as I am worried this may be a life, death situation as indicated by the paramedic and the doctor consult.

She sends in the head nurse. She takes me aside in a private area and asks me what my concern is.  I try to explain my concern, but she interrupts me a lot and tells me that they will do an EKG.

I wanted to explain to her that I am in no hurry as long as My wife’s condition is not life threatening.  Just tell me she is fine, and we will wait patiently to see a Doctor.

After another very long period of time she gets the EKG.
I ask the person doing the test about the result and she says she can’t tell us and that someone will get back to us.

I go again to the front desk and some tells me if it were urgent they would have dealt with it.

After over 2 hours in this shopping cart wheelchair, my wife asks to be somewhere more comfortable.  It seemed cruel to leave her like this.  I then ask if she can get some Gravol, so we can just go home where she can be comfortable.

The staff member says that is not a good idea and we should wait to see a doctor.  By now it’s about 3 hours.  I ask if she can lie down somewhere and the staff moves her to a recliner.  This makes her feel better.

My wife throws up.  I go to the desk holding the bag and ask what to do with it.  A staff member takes it.

After some time, my wife asks for another Gravol as she threw up the first one.  I ask the staff member for another and he says he is not My wife’s assigned nurse.

My wife is still very sick and no Gravol.  I ask the nurse again and she says she didn’t know My wife needed one.  I told her I asked for one a ½ hour before.  She (Natalie) then lost it and yelled at me telling me I have been rude and condescending.  I kept my voice down in spite of being yelled at and told her that I had not once been rude or condescending but rather was concerned about My wife’s health.  I told her that patients are not the enemy.  She turned her back on me.

When the doctor did come (after over 3 hours), I brought this to his attention and he said not to distract him with this.  At one point I mentioned we waited over 3 hours to Natalie and she said “that the wait time” as though this is acceptable.

After the doctor had completed the assessment on My wife, I read him the following quote from the hospital website:

“Quality health care is important to all of us at Island Health. Your feedback will further improve the quality of the health care system.
If you have a compliment or a complaint, please first speak with the person who provided the service, or to the manager of the area.
Complaints are best addressed and resolved at the time and place they occur. If your complaint remains unresolved after discussing the issue with the service area, we encourage you to contact our Patient Care Quality Office. “

I asked him if I should take this up with him or someone else.  He said to take it up with the Patient Care Quality Office."

I sat there wrapped in a sleeping bag, bloody and bruised, with a swollen eye until a nurse asked me into an exam room. Her primary exam of me was VERY brief, and I was asked to leave the room and sit back in the Ambulatory area to await the attending physician. When he became available, I was brought back into the exam room, where he only examined my eye and said he would need to figure out if I would require an x-ray or not, and offered to get the nurse to bring me some Tylenol. I was never x-rayed. I did not see him again during my time at the hospital.

After a domestic assault, the WORST thing that could’ve been done was to place me in a room with two men, whom I did not know. I waited nearly an hour and a half before I got up to go to the nurse’s desk and requested the Tylenol that the Dr had said the nurse would bring to me. The department was very quiet, and the nurses were busy behind the desk having a jovial conversation. I did not see my nurse, or doctor for the remainder of my time at VGH. It wasn’t until the hospital social worker arrived that I was finally treated with some DIGNITY. She brought me to a vacant private room, where I could talk about what happened, cry and be comforted. She offered me water and a muffin, and allowed me to use her cellphone so that I could finally call my family and tell them where I was. At no point during my time in the ER was my emergency contact ever called and told that I was there. VGH's domestic violence protocol NEEDS to be changed! I've never been so humiliated as I was that night."

My granddaughter had to seek medical attention, due to an injury, but the male attendant refused to allow her mom to enter with her. He suggested that at 17 she was old enough to wait on her own. He was rude and condescending as my daughter attempted to explain to him that my granddaughter suffers from several disorders due to traumatic events.
My granddaughter called me sobbing because she was alone and afraid. This is unacceptable, even during these trying times. Perhaps a small act of kindness or compassion from this inconsiderate man and his male colleague could have alleviated some of her fears.
Once I have the name of this individual I will report his unprofessional conduct."

I was sitting in the front seat of a minivan next to a nearby building, and an old lady was pouring water out of the sliding door in the back! Please come and get it. As soon as I put my hand out, I heard a loud bang at the door, and my hand hurt! ! See you soon! ! There was a sound coming from the door, and my jaw hurt.

I had my hand in my hand, and when the old lady started driving, my mouth went into my hand, ouch! ! There's no water either.

He didn't pay attention to me and drove towards town.

When I was young, I used to think that children were not good. It's not like that, but the old lady is dangerous and dangerous! !

Young children don't know many things, but attacking and bullying them is obviously prohibited.
