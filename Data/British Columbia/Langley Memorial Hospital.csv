We went to Langley Hospital, but after a blood test, they told us that we would have to wait in line for over 8 hours. My daughter felt like she was going to die while waiting, and she was crying. Then, an acquaintance advised us to go to Surrey Memorial Hospital for quicker treatment, so we rushed there. Of course, we still had to wait, but in the pediatric department, we only waited about an hour, and they were able to act quickly enough to alleviate my daughter’s symptoms. I am extremely disappointed with Langley Hospital. I understand that there’s always a wait to see a doctor, but having to wait this long in an emergency situation makes me question how they expect patients to survive.

A few days later, my daughter’s test results came back concerning, and she was admitted to BC Children’s Hospital in Vancouver, where she underwent various tests and treatments for two weeks. Even though I live in Langley, we had to go to Surrey for emergency care, and they provided substantial help. I am extremely disappointed with Langley Memorial. While I understand the lack of doctors, it’s clear that they fail to properly assess what qualifies as a critical emergency."

They have 2 doctors working the entire hospital each night. No this is not a typo, 2 doctors for 5+ “zones”. Even if you are zone 2. Have fun waiting a minimum of 8 hours. If you have any life threatening emergency please DO NOT come here. You will die. It’s disgusting what goes on here. We have nurses complaining 24/7 about salaries, short staffing etc… but yet you walk in here see a bunch of kids standing around chatting. What’s the point of having these many nurses if they can’t do anything until 1 of 2 doctors have seen the patient ? I’m not even joking see for yourself majority of them are standing in the waiting room chatting and laughing and if you ask for help, at best they will give you a sincere apology and say they can’t do anything. Ok so what are you getting paid for then ? I get that they can’t diagnose, but I’m sure you can atleast be competent. Was sitting in the ER next to a teen who was the victim of a major car accident. Bleeding from his face/head (not profusely) and glass in his face, the solution? They offered him a blanket because it’s going to be a long wait Lol. Yes you read that right. Blood coming from your head? Have an old blanket. What a joke. Don’t call yourself a hospital when you have a LOWER CAPACITY then a walk in clinic. Yes walk in clinics used to have 3+ doctors… Everyone here top to bottom should be ashamed of themselves."

Although I could easily give 5 for the overall experience including the  amazing care I got from the nurses , however , they missed on something very important after that which is sending to vital statistics the notice birth of my son with the wrong birth date. This act, delayed the process of us getting the passport and meeting the work commitments we have for 2 weeks. I am still wondering how could someone make such a mistake?"

I was taken to zone 2 where I had an amazing nurse till around 4pm,  at 430 I was brought back to a bed/chair to see the doctor. Now from this time till 11pm I had no nurse check on me, do any vitals. So I got myself up and went to the desk to ask if I was forgotten about.  Nurse was very rude I turned back to my chair to finally have the doctor come about 10 mins later. I tell her I had no nurse check in on me or do vitals and I wasn’t given Tylenol I was told by the 4pm nurse I would get in 4 more hours if I was still here.

Now I get our health care system sucks that’s to our lovely pos Trudeau, but when u have nurse walking past not even popping their head in to make sure I’m still alive, their is a huge problem with that and that needs to be fixed asap.

I’m super disgusted with Langley hospital"

I'll share my experience. I arrived at emergency around 7am. I immediately seen a clerk(intake)and got admitted, a few minutes later I was assessed by a nurse and told them what was going on. I had severe abdominal pain. After about a 10 minute wait I was moved to zone 2 for blood work and had my vitals taken. Approximately 1hr later I was moved to zone 3 for treatment and to see a doctor. I had my own room which was nice and waited about 45 minutes to see a doctor. I was given pain meds while waiting for the doctor. The doctor was patient and took his time to understand my concerns. He scheduled a CT scan to get a better understanding of what was happening in my abdomen.  Only a 20 min wait for the CT scan and had to wait another 30 minutes or so for results. I was given pain meds and given IV while I was waiting for results and treated very well. My results came within 30 minutes after the scan and was told I had an inflamed gull bladder, gallstones within bile ducts that was casing blockage and severe pain. Was told I needed emergency surgery to remove my gull bladder and within a couple of hrs I was in the OR. From start to finish I was always kept informed of what was happening. A total of maybe 6hrs from the moment I walked in the ER to the OR. In my opion that ain't too bad. The surgery was just over an hour and half and I was placed in my own room to recover afterwards.  I did have to stay overnight which I was told patients usually go home a few hours after this type of surgery but I had a few more things going on and they wanted to make sure I was ok before I left. I felt very comfortable and would like to give my sincere gratitude for the care that was given to me from start to finish. Overall a very good experience for me. I'm home now and feel great. Thank you again L.M.H !!!"

No appointment necessary.. well that is not entirely true.  I walked in at 310pm on a Wed and found out that I have to register.. huh. I have my requisition and was told go before 330 from the fraser health clinic that booked my surgery.. well I guess our system decided that registration clerks only work until 3pm..  I understand that they can't work 24/7 etc.. but it's kinda funny how most services are open until 4 or 430pm. But you can't use those services because you're not registered.. so now I have to come back to do a 5 minute ecg. Because I have to get it done with fraser health because I guess it's not cool to have it done at life labs??

Triage collected very little information from me other than me stating that my back hurt (no vitals, current medications, previous medical history).

Dr Altman came over, didn’t ask a single question or do an assessment. Before I even spoke he made a diagnosis of a muscle spasm. I tried to explain my symptoms further (numbness, weakness, etc) and he interrupted me. He tapped my lower back twice and said it was muscle spasms.

I went to Lion’s Gate the next day and the CT found two herniated discs. They put me on the proper pain management plan and rehabilitation.

Dr Altman, I promise you nobody wants to be in emerg. Many of us go as long as possible at home to avoid the trip and taking up seats in emerg.

Be curious and ask your patients questions. I’m a Respiratory Therapist and am appalled at your behaviour as a health care professional.  The experience at Lion’s Gate was night and day which shows where the issue lies."

Registration was Fast, Followed by Blood and Urine tests done. Waiting was a little harsh but none the less better than Abbotsford hospital. Nurses on this shift were polite except to one in Grey outfit not uniform with a bit of attitude , all other white nurses were very Friendly , some came around to ask if we needed drinks or warm blankets which was a beautiful thing which we had never experienced in Surrey, Abbotsford, Mission, St Paul's and few other Fraser Valley Hospitals. Was seen by Doctor Ben Sheppard, an awesome caring doctor who was in no hurry to jump to the next patient without giving you his full attention. I wish I could remember the names of these beautiful nurses with beautiful smiles. By 11pm me and sis were very hungry and no place was open , we asked the nurse who was pulling a double shift and she gave us Orange 🍊 juice, Salmon Sandwich, Cheeses and Crackers.
I'd like these nurses on duty to be recognized for their Friendliest, Caring nature. U don't usually find that in late night shift nurses and doctors. At least not at Surrey or Abbotsford hospital. Once again thank you to the Beautiful Receptionists , Nurses and Dr Sheppard. It was a good 7 hours spent in a Friendly , Clean environment. Impressed and not hoping to get sick again but wouldn't mind visiting you lovely ladies and Gent again. Happy Monday"

Was it a wait? Yes, of course!  its an emergency department in bc after all!  hospital waitlist online said 4hr 45m when getting there, it was pretty close to that, perhaps a bit longer, HOWEVER when I interacted with any staff member I did not feel as though I was bothering them, and when I did finally get to see the Dr, I was pleasantly surprised. Dr Carolyn(I hope I got that right, I was in alot of pain!) Was kind, genuinely gave off an empathetic vibe, and did exactly what I had hoped would happen to help me. She was one of the nicest doctors I have encountered in quite a while! I had a friend who was also in the emergency department waiting to see a doctor and her experience was not only quick (less than an hour) but the doctor she saw was also super great. (Unfortunately I don't know his name) I know it's incredibly difficult to have to wait especially when you are in a lot of pain. I was almost in tears by the time I did see the doctor myself, but knowing how broken our Healthcare System is right now we need to remember that it isn't the Hospital doing this to us,  they are trying they're very best to help, If you want to be angry at someone write a letter to David Eby and let him know instead of taking it out on the people who are actually trying to help you.. did I like the wait? NO! would I do it again if it meant the same Dr and level of care when I did, ABSOLUTELY YES!
Also saw ""dirty Hospital"" comments from some people, I found it quite the opposite, MUCH cleaner than the last Hospital I've been to (cgh) I would choose to go here again."

In subsequent visits, I had my foot accidentally broken by their staff, for which they destroyed the surveillance videos and outright lied about it, completely shirking responsibility.

Forever. For the rest of my life. Her justification was that ""no surgeon will perform the operation, they'll just make it worse.""

I talked to my family doc when he came available- and deemed the injury to be significantly life altering, and scheduled a lap surgery within a few days.

I am from Edmonton, and became ill with a very dangerous condition while visiting in the Langley area. I had two back to back Emergency visits in two days.
For starters, I would pick this hospital over any hospital in Edmonton. I was a police officer in Edmonton, and spent much of my life as a patrol officer, so I had lots of exposure to every ER in Edmonton. Medical staff always do their best, working with what they have. I give credit to all hard working medical staff
I found the Langley ER to be efficient and well run. The staff was friendly and helpful. The doctors I dealt with were also friendly and thorough. If I were to choose where I wanted to have the misfortune of requiring emergency care, I would pick this hospital in a heartbeat. There may be a general two star rating for this hospital, but I would give it a 5 star rating any day. Thanks, guys, for taking care of this out of province tourist who got sick on your turf.

Every time we come here, we are forced to wait for 10 to 12 hours before being seen by a doctor. The service is appallingly slow, and the staff behaves as if the urgency of the situation is irrelevant, contrary to what one should expect from an emergency department.

We pay substantial taxes yet receive subpar service in return. It’s disheartening to see that despite the high taxes we pay, the quality of care and efficiency in public hospitals like Langley Memorial are severely lacking. The lack of accountability and motivation to improve is evident, and it’s unacceptable.

Langley Memorial Hospital's emergency department needs a complete overhaul to improve its efficiency and responsiveness. Until then, expect long waits and poor service. This hospital is failing its community."

I had kidney stone pain about 2 months ago and went to langley hospital. I was referred to a urologist who has been helping to get me treated. Urologist wrote a CT scan as i had lot of pains lately from the stone which is scheduled in 2 weeks. However, my pains became worse and i went back to langley hospital today as my urologist is on vacation for next 2 weeks. This is where i meet Dr Altman after 6 hours of wait in pain. He checked kidneys by tapping them, checks for other symptoms and right away says there are no issues. You continue to show urologist and go home. I argued a lot to do ct scan today as i have a stone stuck in pee area which has likely come down and blocking my ability to pee and lot of pain. He waas so adamant and told me that he will not write CT scan even though it is going to anyways happen in 2 weeks. I told him you are sending me home in pain with no diagnosis and i am not leaving this hospital without any proper treatment. He threatened me that his treatment is done, so leave or he will have to call security to take me out of the hospital. Poor nurses could not do much and i had to leave the hospital with no resolution. He is one of the worst doctors i have even dealt with. No sympathy or concerns"

In that time they did EKG, blood tests,  chest and heart ultrasound and x rays and got all the results. Wasn't any major but was good to get checked out.  Would have taken much longer had I done myself and in multiple times and places.
I thought it was really good to get that all done.

And right now it’s 6:30am. Still no sign of doctor and uncertainty of when. Soon the walk in clinics will be open. Should we leave now and go to walk in clinic just to save few more hours of suffering in pain even though we have waited for around 6hrs already?
And next time, should we ask our kids (6 and 2 yr old) to endure the pain until morning so we can go to clinic directly?
Not complaining about hospital but I m brainstorming about what is best when small kids are the one suffering.

Status at 7am: as per nurses, they have 10 patients in the queue before our kid and will take 3 hrs for our son to get his turn which comes around 10am.

In total we can confidently conclude, if we go to ER the least expected waiting time will be 10hrs like others are saying in their reviews. The lesson we learned from this is, staying at home with suffering in pain and go to walk in clinic in the morning or going to Surrey memorial and waiting in pediatric are
still better options than waiting for more than 10hrs with uncertainty."

The province cutting back by eliminating food to the patients who have waited hours and hours to be seen by ER is absurd. Our tax dollars pay for these necessities, but the government aka ‘tyrants’ as per usual, do what they want. My 13 hour wait and stay at Langley Memorial was not fun, but at the end of the day, I got checked out by professionals and came home  with medication and assurance I would get better. Shame on this government for taking away from healthcare which is such a fundamental, and important necessity in our country, and what we are known for. DO BETTER. There is a mass exodus with the boomers causing a shortage in staff, and the cost for nursing school is so high. DO BETTER. Make education more affordable for this profession.

I've been committed to the solitary confinement rooms 5 times now and red flagged by the computer system because I fight back against the oppression. Who is the time lord? I'm actually healthy and not sick. Know what COVID-19 is? I love playing the game Humanity.

Just a few observations that will make our little community a little happier.  Lets start - we all have dreams and aspirations. Some people dream of becoming pilots, some teachers, and some doctors. That's why a doctor would be a fantastic addition to the emergency triage. An actual doctor can make intelligent, insightful decisions on the acuity of the patient, rather than the person that was hired, whom Im sure shared that dream of becoming a doctor, but just couldn't quite buckle down in school, like the aforementioned fellow with a large PhD diploma plastered to the wall of above a dusty mantle. Thus creating a contentious relationship between said wannabe doctor and patient.  This eventually evolves into a shared deep regret about life that must be reviewed amongst peers, thus holding up the triage line again. So as to a second suggestion; I believe this time among peers to ponder life choices is great, as a taxpayer, I think - the designated breaktimes should not only include the holy and revered coffee machine and the almighty and regal water cooler, but should include a sacred area  for a group therapy circle, where healing can finally begin."

They did x-ray but the doctor did not even mention anything about that when they saw us (they must've not found anything but something still to be mentioned) and did not even recommend any medication for pain (like no mention of it at all). We called the following day for an inquiry (since it quite a way for us) if it's possible to be placed on an air cast instead since it's not a bone injury or at least know our other options but the lady on the phone just assumed that I'm questioning their service and didn't even answer my question and hang up.

I am trying my best to focus on my breathing because my heart is racing and this man is yelling at me to stop shaking, to look at my fingers they’re shaking. He then proceeds to yell at me to breathe normally then try’s to ask me why I am here after I have been treated. He put me into a full blown panic attack from the way he treated me. Maybe he is new to medical care but I have never been treated like this from a doctor. I kept telling him I couldn’t stop shaking because of the epi pen and I was trying to but he was just repeating himself. I think maybe he should go back to medical school and learn the side effects of different medications? Every time I have had an allergic reaction I have only ever been treated with kindness, doctors usually check in with you and ask how the medication is affecting their clients not bully them into crying while they are dealing with the side effects. I would not recommend this doctor to anyone because it seems like a safety concern frankly, not knowing the side effects of medications could be potentially dangerous. In the midst of this ordeal he also asked me when the ambulance took me in when what happened is I admitted myself to this hospital because it was the closest one to my friends house I was visiting.

Though I do not have his name I spoke with him at 9:10pm in emergency care yesterday August 2, 2023, he appeared to be young in his 30s and of Chinese decent."

On a the few occasions I felt I needed to be there or my child needed to be at the ER, I have to say, people could use more compassion and care for people that sincerely feel they are in need of Emergency attention. Remarks like “you don’t need to be here” when circumstances arise where you feel you do but then get pushed out the door after a 7 hour wait is ridiculous and for any doctor to remark that it’s easy to find a family doctor deems a doctor socially unintelligent. I understand there are people that take advantage of the system, but not everyone does, and regardless some people just need some care and compassion on a tough day. Being pushed away and refused help, was how my grandfather passed away and others I know have died or have ended up with serious issues from being pushed out the door. At the very least treating people like they actually matter no matter the circumstance is not a big ask, is it?"

We were in a room beside the nursing station, we could overhear nurses mentioning patients names, their diagnosis, and horrible nicknames like “the crazy anxiety girl”. Lastly, I understand the need for efficiency when understaffed, but I found it uncomfortable and shocking when the doctor came to tell me my results in the public waiting room.

I was told to go home 4 different days. After 10 days of unbearable pain around the clock I went back a 5th time to hear the specialist also tell me “we don’t know what’s wrong”. They did one ultrasound and some urine tests. Not once was my blood even taken. I researched on my own what could be wrong with me and asked for a specific test. Within 20 minutes I was having said test and a large kidney stone was found lodged in my ureter. It was removed at that point. I was 35 weeks pregnant with our fifth baby (So I was unable to be given anything to manage the pain), my husband had to be off work to care for our other children & the ER kept sending me to the maternity ward where multiple doctors refused to see me for a urology issue. It was a mess. No one could figure out what was wrong. In the end I’m glad for Google where I solved my own problem after an understaffed hospital with overworked doctors didn’t have time to help me. There is 1 amazing obgyn (Dr. Hawkins) who is an angel and was determined to help even though I wasn’t having a maternity issue!

People who came in after me all got to see the doctor before me and left. My pain worsened to a point where I had to walk out with no help at all. I'd rather try a walk in clinic. What's funny is that public hospitals like this one from a less privileged country is super clean and you get to see the doctor so quickly, the ER never has a waiting time, hell it don't even have a waiting area.

I managed to cut my hand open in the evening, and with all walk in clinics closed, the only option was to go to visit the ER. After I arrived just after 9:30pm and was told it would not take long. close to 7 hours later I was finally admitted just after 4:30AM. During my wait, I witnessed the triage nurses and admin staff act in a rude manor to almost everyone coming through. Let me make it clear, I'm not expecting customer service in an ER. That said, people should still act with human decency.

The real issue came with the single bathroom for the entire waiting room.
During the more than 6 hours I was there, multiple people, clearly sick, spent long periods of time puking and doing who knows what in the bathroom. During that time, not a single staff member cleaned or sanitized ANYTHING. Not the bathroom, not the admin desks, not the chairs. Now you may think, maybe they were all too busy? Nope, they spent hours chatting each other up. What's worse is when a woman finally asked them if they could clean the washroom after someone could be heard VIOLENTLY throwing up and again they said no. In BC, where there are strict cleaning policies in place, this would not be acceptable ANYWHERE. The fact that this is happening in a hospital where most people entering are potentially sick is ridiculous.

I would like to mention that both the ER physician and nurses were incredibly kind and helpful to me and the others once I was admitted. That said, it was clear they were severely understaffed. Even then, I can live with waiting 7 hours. That is part of life, especially when I was there for merely some stitches. That said, the lack of respect for patients or cleaning protocol is a stain on the Canadian public care system."

I recently received all my pregnancy care and C-section procedure for my first pregnancy at LMH, and I was quite simply blown away with the entire experience. Seems to me that LMH has a fantastic maternity department. For my whole pregnancy the Maternity Clinic provided thorough and professional care with lovely doctors who took the time to answer all my questions and make referrals as necessary. I always felt like I was in good hands, and each doctor I met was thorough and completely competent in their care delivery. The Mat. Clinic works on a Dr. rotation so you almost always see a different Dr. at each visit, but the Clinic is organized and cohesive in their care delivery.

The actual scheduled c-section and aftercare experience in the Maternity Ward was incredible! Dr. Christopher Ng was my surgeon and I have never met a nicer Dr.! The whole surgery team was amazing, and the 2-day aftercare experience really impressed me. Each nurse I encountered was extremely nice and helpful, and went above and beyond to make sure I was always comfortable and also had lovely advice for me if I had any questions while learning to take care of a baby (special shout-out to Nurses Tammy, Zayna, and Preety).

I feel extremely blessed to live in a country where our social healthcare system provided me with such a lovely and calm birthing experience; complete with a large private room; competent and caring nurses; free formula, diapers, and wipes while in hospital, and even the 3 hospital meals a day were great!

If you will be under the care of LMH for your pregnancy, I would say you are lucky, and from my experience you will receive top level care. Thank you LMH!!"

I was in on Jan 31st and thanks to a lack of clinics open the ER was packed.  Luckily I got there at 8am and there was only 4 people ahead of me. I waited 3 hours and in that 3 hours over 40 people came in due to the fact the clinics that were open were lined out the door and there was no guarantee they would be seen so off the the ER they were forced to go. The nurses are doing the best they can with what they have. They were kind enough but you could see they were on edge from hours of abuse from sick people who are frustrated and taking it out on them. The doctors were great but over worked. Desperately trying to find the balance of doing a good job and being quick enough to get through the long line of people who need help. At the end of the day the doctors, nurses and staff are doing every thing they can to help. They need more staff, more beds, more more more... and it is something they cannot fix without significant help.... so I am giving 5 stars because as far as hospitals go we got in, we were seen and we got the medication I needed for my toddler.

And even better, not only one, but two bacteria (both you typically only get it in hospitals). I know it’s hard to keep it clean since there’s lots of people working and people coming in and out everyday but I’m pretty shocked that my wife came back ill with two illnesses that you can only get in hospitals, knowing we are in a pandemic with COVID19; you would think they would keep the hospital clean. On top of that they prescribed my wife with antibiotics that even was not for the bacteria she was infected for. AND those antibiotics were not supposed to be prescribed to her since my wife is breastfeeding. We communicated that my wife is breastfeeding and they still prescribed us with the antibiotics telling us it’s safe to still breastfeed. A week later, we discover from a pharmacy that the antibiotics should have not been prescribed as it’s not recommended to breastfeed while she was on those antibiotics. It’s been 4 weeks since my wife is back from the C-Section but she hasn’t been showing any recovery. Typically the C-Section recovery is 6 weeks. She is in her week 4 and no improvements."

It was a very tramatic event for us and we both can't say enough about the staff at the Emergency room at Langley Memorial.  The doctor we saw (Dr. Anthony) was AMAZING!  He was very personable, jovial with great bedside manner.  He made us feel reassured and confident despite the fact that we were going through a very tough time.  He was professional and courteous and had a fantastic bedside manner.  The nurses that looked after us when we were first admitted and throughout the whole process (Male nurse Chris and Female nurse Hillary) were also AMAZING.  They both were super compassionate, attentive, answered all of our questions and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and cared for in our time of need.    The admissions people in the ER entrance were also kind and attentive.

I understand that people get annoyed when they wait hours to see a doctor but if you just take a step back and recognize that 1. you will always be seen by a physician and 2. this service is FREE and 3. these doctors are swamped from morning until night with patients many of them unnecessary patients perhaps it will give you some perspective.  Despite the demands on these staff members day in and day out they still managed to make us feel reassured and cared for and they had a direct impact on how we dealt with our situation and how it will be remembered by us forever.

We can't say enough about this ER and the doctors and nurses that make it great.  Please keep up the good work and remember that you may hear negative far more often than positive as is human nature but you are making a difference for individuals like us."
