I was in for a day surgery this afternoon. The nurses all kept me constantly posted on the wait time, as there was an emergency ahead of me so my surgery was delayed a few hours. They provided me with as many heated blankets as I needed, braided my hair, put on my booties, we had great conversations. They smiled lots and were very reassuring. I never felt worried or nervous. They also looked like they were having a good afternoon themselves despite how busy it was, so I didn’t get any stress vibes from them. The communication from nurses, surgeons, and anesthesiologist was fantastic from start to finish.

I truly appreciate the care. Thank you so much"

I'm used to dealing with the psych unit at Nanaimo District Hospital where there have been very empathetic, kind and understanding professionals. Within an hour if being here, I was asked three times in a row what my issue was I was coming in for (SH issues) and I had to explain continually something I was humiliated to talk about with a stanger.

Three gave up and walked out. I could see staff gathered in a small group just talking and laughing at something - looked relaxed. It was a 4 1/2 wait. My mother-in-law had arrived in an ambulance. She's frail and 101 years old. The triage desk put her into a chair that resembles a shopping cart. When we got there a few minutes after the ambulance, she had already been placed into the waiting area, her head slumped forward and she was vomiting down her front and into her lap. The triage desk gave us a hand towel. A return visit won us a small plastic vomit bag. She was in pain with a severe blockage. We insisted at the triage desk that she be afforded something to recline or lay on. The 'gatekeeper' said, ""There are not beds available, she'll just have to wait in line like everybody else."" Then the diarrhea started. The poor woman was spraying from both ends and public bathroom was a mess. The triage desk handed us a depends diaper, a pair of hospital pajamas and a couple of those little foiled sani-wipes (the kind you get when you fly first class). Still no physical help or change in her triage status. An hour later, I had to look for a different washroom for myself because the mess in the first one hadn't been touched. I'm a retired first responder and I've never seen the like to this anywhere else. There's a new hospital coming...are they taking the old triage staff with them? Once admitted - treatment upstairs from the doctors and nurses was excellent. The downstairs 'gateway' is however a hell-scape. Any credo of 'Do no harm' has already stumbled out moaning in agony."

I empathize for all healthcare staff and I am thankful they continue to do what they do. But going to the ER is never fun and often is a brave decision for someone to choose to go there for medical help. Making someone feel embarrassed for choosing to go for whatever symptoms they have is wrong. No one wants to wait hours in an ER for a doctor - but when they choose to, there is a reason they did and that should be taken seriously. Listen to your patients  - give them empathy and validation at the very least. Truly, I feel helpless. It very hard to find support and care. Clinics are often no help, Family doctors are far and few, so I thought going to the ER was going to be a helpful tool to get immediate and necessary help. I was wrong."

This was the worst experience I have ever had. I was at the hospital last week and received an amazing amount of care bravo to the amazing staff I had on the 2 ND for, 217 2. in 5 days I was rejected for the hospital. Both times were at 1030 at night.

I attempted humor as it was amazingly successful. The large nurse pulled has back grey hair and glasses and a blue shirt.

She asked me what she could do. I asked if I could get my old room back for a while. She said ""what"". I explained. She didn't and get it and went in to tell me to go to warm land. I said I was scared and that normal people go .I guess she isn't aware. Then she asks why I don't have a back up plan. I did and they ask fell apart.  I explained, she still didn't get it.

This happened twice at 4 30 in the morning.

This morning's incident was worse. Let's just say the security was involved twice, and I'm super funny chilled and relaxed. I wish I had been able to use my camera but the battery was dead.

I was admitted to the hospital last Saturday and was released on Thursday (almost 6 days). I was blown away with the high standard of care I was given. Every nurse, doctor, porter and cleaner had a smile on their face and a kind word for everyone. I watched how each person in my room was cared for with kindness and compassion. The hospital is old, so I was expecting it to be dirty and have that hospital smell … I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness (I watched the ER cleaner wipe every surface and in my room I watched them literally take everything apart and prep for the next patient - note, this is a must, but I’m skeptical that this protocol is adhered to in every facility).

Thank you to the entire staff for getting me back to good health and for providing such great care. I hope I never have to go back, but if I do, I know I’ll be well taken care of.

Warmly,

Went to the emergency with a painful, severely swollen inflamed wrist,waited for full four hours after checking in,even though it was empty. Got tired of waiting and pain, decided to go back home. I thought the staff are paid to take care of the public who go to the emergency care for a reason. I felt it was a fish market and the staff were on vacation, talking about their personal issues while I was there waiting for four hours 🙃.SHAMEFUL!"

We, the family were okay with this move until were ejected at 2230 told it was against policy to allow any family to stay the night as he was now in a 4 bed room.  As he is dying, and had been Promised he would not be left alone, we were understandably distressed, especially since he choked three seperate times that only our being here saved him as he was unable to call out or Find the callbell in time! Dad was nearly in tears and didnt understand, and the only comfort given was, well a nurse will look in once an hour!
