My brother meet with an accident & was brought here by the ambulance . When we came in the receptionist was so racist, we asked her to open door n she would pretend she didn’t listen and would talk to her asian patients. I had to call security guy, who was next to her office to get in.
But the situation gets worst when my  brother was kept overnight and next morning too on the ambulance exit gate. The receptionist would come n say to move him but the hospital staff would keep him over there. Like where are the rules ? Not only my brother was in danger but also there were so many transfer happening from that door. The nurses and receptionist have 0 empathy & follow no rules , casually sitting using phone and ignoring patients. Can’t understand how can you leave someone overnight & for next day on this gate it self"

I received wonderful care for my MRI, CT and other procedures at Richmond hospital. I had a surgical daycare procedure 2 weeks ago at Richmond Hospital and it was hands down the best care, my nurse even stayed with me after her shift time to help me meet the post surgery criteria so I could go home. Every nurse, clerk, tech, doctor, intern, student anesthesiologist and anesthesiologist who took care of me was AMAZING. The anesthesia team I had was particularly INCREDIBLE! Caring, patient and medical trauma informed are just some of the attributes I encountered. Also, the facility was quiet, clean and comfortable despite being on the older side."

The colonoscopy reception lady was friendly and calmed me down to face the coming procedure that I hate.

There were two round of colonoscopy nurses: the 1st one checked and explained the procedure to me very clearly, from patient perspective; the 2nd nurse help to dressed me up (IV, bp set up), she was kind and professional.

In the procedure room, the two nurses and Dr. Nam Nguyen formed a very efficient team. Dr. Nguyen is top notch, and yet still spent time to explain clearly the results and what to do next.

My mom and grandmother got off a cruise ship and my grandmother became ill. They took her to this hospital on a Saturday. She was diagnosed with influenza type A. A few IVs and Tamiflu and she would be on her way. Nope. The Dr took advantage of her being private pay since she was from the U.S. By the time she was discharged Monday for her flight home, she was diagnosed with low potassium, low magnesium, a kidney infection, UTI, kidney stone, blood infection, fluid in both lungs, and the doctor advised she stay for the entire week because all the tests they performed would take a week to come back......... even though they diagnosed her with all the above. My grandmother flew home and immediately went to her family Dr. A blood test, EKG, Ultrasound and x-ray showed there was absolutely no issues with her. Shame on this hospital and their doctors for putting an elderly person through so much bullshit. Let's not forget to mention they were extremely concerned with her oxygen level. Sooo concerned that when they brought her back from her ultrasound, they mistakenly never put her oxygen and pulse ox back on. 4 hours later when it was discovered, her O2 was 96. I'm not a Dr but 96 is normal and acceptable for a person above 80. Maybe I should apply to work at this hospital. I seem to know more than most.
If you feel ill, just take the risk of death. The bill they send you in the end will give you a heart attack anyways. Might as well risk the drive to go somewhere else!!"

To the team (Doctor and OR nurses) that did the C section- You guys are all amazing!

Nurse Madison who took care of us when we arrived.

Nurse Sheen- very friendly and at the same time professional

Nurse Melinda and Nurse Deborah- you guys are great and informative.

Nurse Wendy and Jody - Great team.

Nurse Aly- Gave us proper care all throughout her shift.

Nurse Heather- Her and Nurse Angela professionally managed my wife's pain when my wife's bladder got distended (due to catheter removal) and was giving her a one hell nightmare of pain.

Nurse Angela and Rav- The best duo. They made us feel that we were not in a hospital with their professional and at the same time friendly manner, plus all the hacks for taking care of the baby and pain management that Nurse Angela taught us. Nurse Rav made sure that we have all we need and checking on us whenever she's available.

Most of all, to nurse Kernix (I hope I got it her name right) who never leave us when my wife was in labor. She did even not want to leave our side even though her shift has already ended.

The nurse couldn’t find my vein so she started to move the needle inside my arm which of course hurt. Since she couldn’t find it she used the other arm and started moving again. After the painful experience she said it was my fault because I had to be “relaxed”.

Then the doctor came and he was super nice and gave me the medication needed. The doctor said the pharmacy was going to contact me and that I shouldn’t do anything else.

A few days passed and the pharmacy never contacted me, so I called them. And they told me very upset that it was my responsibility to contact my family doctor for the rest of the medication. Which I would have done if the doctor didn’t tell to not do anything.

Despite my distress and prolonged wait, my encounter at the hospital left me deeply disheartened and frustrated. Here's a recount of my experience:

After enduring almost four hours of waiting and pleading to see a doctor, I was finally attended to by Dr. S. FEDDER in the emergency department. However, to my disappointment, Dr. FEDDER's response to my condition was far from satisfactory. Despite my explanation of the intense pain and my belief that my lower disc had slipped causing compression on the nerve, ( had MRI done few days ago) Dr. FEDDER simply dismissed my symptoms as sciatica nerve pain. He asserted that there was nothing further they could do to alleviate my suffering.

Feeling desperate for relief, I requested morphine, a medication that had provided some comfort in the past. Shockingly, Dr. FEDDER callously refused my request, leaving me feeling helpless and abandoned in my time of need.

My experience at [Hospital Name] today has raised serious concerns about the effectiveness and compassion of Canada's healthcare system. It seems that the focus is more on managing symptoms with painkillers rather than addressing the root causes of patients' ailments and providing effective treatment options.

Furthermore, I must express my shock at the discrepancy between the medical advice I received abroad and the response I encountered in Canada. A top neurosurgeon in Dubai had recommended surgery to address the issue, emphasizing the importance of taking proactive measures before the situation worsened. However, the doctor in Canada seemed to have a vastly different approach, stating that surgery would only be considered if I experienced numbness in my private parts. This discrepancy in medical opinions has left me feeling confused and concerned about the quality of healthcare I received.
In conclusion, my experience with Canada's healthcare system has left me feeling more unwell than when I arrived. Today's encounter has left me deeply disheartened and disillusioned. I sincerely hope that sharing my experience will spark a reevaluation of healthcare practices and drive improvements in patient care and outcomes."

That nurse came in and asked me to put my baby in the crib box, and told me that is not safe to let the baby sleep on my bed. As I just got a C section, my wound is getting more painful, so firstly, I wouldn’t easily fall asleep; secondly, if the nurse really want their patient  to get more rest after the surgery, why she kept doing the opposite? I was awake at that time, that means I would not roll over and hold my baby down.

That being said even before the healthcare crisis was on a role  & the pandemic you started to see the decline of Patient Care the amount of people immigrating to Canada overtime plus the aging population and the number of Physicians retiring have placed a heavy strain on the system.. Overtime though it  has gone from bad to worse I have seen and experienced the mediocre care from doctors and nurses are alike  in every hospital I’ve visited not just Rmd General.  The care and the compassion from the doctors & nurses we depend on and the quality of service is an absolute embarrassment to Canada 🇨🇦.  Who’s to blame our Politicians & Government have let this slide to a point of no return.  Unfortunately freebies like medical and free education K to 12 the Cdn Government still encourages People to immigrate here with these so called incentives to attract more and more people to settle down here only to find some of them  cannot afford a place to live put enough food on their plates and end up working for minimum low end jobs or homeless.   It’s unfortunate this Government would go to these lengths to screw Canadians to this degree.
We are at a breaking point and the doctors & nurses are not going to change for the better it never really was you were fortunate to receive quality care from  a handful of doctors & nurses. The quality of care with your family doctor ( that’s if u have one) is in itself a joke.
If you’re eligible to VOTE in the next general election please do so MAKE A CHANGE for a hopeful outcome bring Canada  back to a higher standard of living like it was once before.

From the moment we stepped through the doors until the day we left with our precious bundle of joy, the entire experience was nothing short of exceptional. Here are just a few reasons why I rate the Richmond Hospital Birth Center with a resounding five stars:

Expert and Compassionate Staff: The staff at the birth center are an incredible team of professionals who genuinely care about the well-being of both the mother and the baby. From the highly skilled doctors and nurses to the friendly administrative staff, everyone went above and beyond to ensure that we felt safe, supported, and well-informed throughout our entire journey.

The private birthing suites are spacious and beautifully decorated, creating a serene and calming environment. Each room is equipped with advanced medical equipment, ensuring that both mother and baby receive the best possible care.
The staff respected and supported our birth plan, providing personalized care that aligned with our preferences and values.
Excellent Prenatal and Postnatal Care: The care we received during prenatal and postnatal stages was exceptional. The hospital provided regular check-ups, informative classes, and support groups that helped us prepare for childbirth and navigate the early stages of motherhood. The dedicated lactation consultants were invaluable in helping us establish breastfeeding successfully.
Warm and Welcoming Atmosphere: Richmond Hospital Birth Center created a warm and welcoming atmosphere that made us feel at ease from the moment we arrived. The staff exuded kindness and patience, ensuring that my wife and I felt comfortable and supported throughout the entire experience. It truly felt like a home away from home.

The expert and compassionate staff, coupled with the state-of-the-art facilities and holistic approach to birth, created an environment that exceeded all our expectations. I wholeheartedly recommend the Richmond Hospital Birth Center to any expectant parent looking for a safe, supportive, and memorable birth experience. Five stars all the way!"

Very bad experience or feeling twice at yellow zone MRI receptionist,  she is very cold and reluctantly to work. She doesn't look at or check patients care card, she just let patients read the number and she has no motion while letting you reading the number.she looks very unhappy while working.
She threw the medical form to chair and left, didn't tell us to fill the form, we realized that we need to fill the form after 20 mins.
Shall she check patient med card and confirm the patient is correct people. And more, shall she tell patient to fill out a form instead  throw it to a chair and left? Are we supposed to get a basic service on Saturday morning?
Actually,  rest of the staff at MRI are very nice and professional,  her attitude is really downgrading others efforts."

Went to the hospital at 3:20am to settle my COVID issues which were being provoked by my insomnia, which itself was being provoked by anxiety. I was in better shape than a number of patients checking in through triage, so I had to wait longer to see a doc (understandably so).

6 hours later, however, and I find myself in a small room and given some apple juice, a vegetarian cheese sandwich and a sample cup to pee in. If the food was a bribe to get me going to the washroom, it worked. I could tell right away I was extremely dehydrated— no fancy lab tests needed to know. The nurses take the near bronze tube in a bag for me. I have no idea what happened.

I start getting cold and the nicest nurse ever draped a blanket over me and dimmed the lights to the room so I could get a nap in.

Dr. Chao was the doctor I woke up too, and I appreciated his skills in scoping my needs while also accentuating that we will build a plan depending on the needs I stated for them that day. I start going into more psychology territory. The doc admits that the call-in psychiatrist would be of better help to me. I’m then lead out of the room by a nurse, and then to a stretcher bed. I was asked if I wanted food. I said yes.  and was presented with waters, orange juice, milks, creamers, and coffee. I jokingly wonder if the nursing team to get a homie hydrated.

I ended up taking a nap. When I wake up and have another tray of food, I’m greeted by Dr. Gill, the call-in psychiatrist contacted by Dr. Chao. He asks me a rather thorough set of evaluative questions regarding my mental health. He asks me what my biggest problems are now. And what kind of solutions do I want to see done. When I answer what I want, Dr. Gill confirms my placements with an Outpatient Psychiatrist to work with; then prescribes me some medicine to help me get to sleep, and lastly a pill that can take the edge off intrusive thoughts at night.

I took these medicines just an hour earlier, and I am feeling fiiiiiine— like I was being sank into my bed by an invisible bear; all the while, the volume of my thoughts puff into a mellow cloud. The clouds are there, but nothing really to be thought about.

Great feeling… hope it translates to a good sleep!

Thank you to the entire Richmond Hospital team for the compassion you share with your care, even with the constant stress you feel for the health of your patients. Thanks for all you do! 🤍✨"

However. Despite the fact my roommate had come in to drop me off, and that several of the staff in the Surgical Day Care watched me hand my cellphone and items to him, and even telling the Staff outright that he was the person picking me up; the staff later accused him of being a unknown person, refusing to answer his questions about whether or not I was okay. They called him to come in an hour earlier, then got angry when he came in when called.
Great doctors, great care for those in surgical care, but I can’t give a hospital 5 stars for being so cruel to those that are there as emergency contacts. I will do everything in my power not to return to this hospital."

Was experiencing chest pains with leg pain at my workplace a public sector. We have a medical clinic and I rushed to see the doctor.  She suspected  a pulmonary embolism and asked me to head to the ER immediately with an ambulance and advice them what the doctor suspected. My manager called 911 and as I work in a public sector where we have paramedic services  they came within minutes and gave me the same rundown as the doctor. They advised me the wait for the ambulance is like an hour and the Richmond hospital is just 10 minutes away.  They said to rush there and let the ER know I have been checked my a medical doctor and paramedics and they suspect a pulmonary embolism and I should be taken right away. My manager rished me to the ER right away.
This is where the nightmare began.
Once at the ER the receptionist could care less about any information I had to share. Kept telling me have a seat.  I multiple times try to explain was I have been told by the doctor and paramedics (apparently it was also remarked somewhere) but she kept cutting me off and kept asking me to have a seat. In panicked andI beg her to listen to me and that is when she tells me if I don't want to wait I can leave. I again just trying to explain and then I am threatened with security.
I sat down frightened ,waited 3 hours till finally called in for ecg, waited another 2 hours to be seen by a doctor who ordered a CT.

The nurses are kind, one time I came really late at night and fell asleep, and a nurse put a hot blanket over me to keep me warm. Your information for why you are here gets around, so you do not need to repeat yourself to every single doctor/nurse/worker that comes to check on you as they already know from the other workers which makes it efficient.

The day before surgery I went for blood work and an ECG. The man taking my blood and the woman doing my ECG have to be the most cold people I have ever met. The man didn't even talk to me, he was quite rough and he bruised my arm for 2 days. Then the woman doing my ECG grabbed me by the shoulder and pushed me down when she thought I was going to take my shirt off and that REALLY upset me.
Then on the day of surgery I was kept waiting for over 2 hours due to staff shortages. In that two hours MULTIPLE staff, patients and visitors were walking around without masks. They force them on you at the door but no one enforces that you wear them.
On top of that I found 90% of the staff to he impersonal and uncaring (due to their staff shortage but that's not my fault). I made everyone aware I have anxiety and ptsd around surgery due to the loss of a child and hardly anything was done to make the experience more comfortable for me. They allowed my husband to be in the recovery room with me but I had to be the one to call him even though I had no idea where I was (and was in the middle of a panic attack).
Now it's been a couple days since my surgery and I am progressively getting more sore. I have charlie horses from the base of my skull down to my ankles. My throat is also becoming more swollen and sore as well. This did not happen to me after the last two surgeries I've undergone and I honestly feel like these people were so rough with me while I was unconscious.
Unless you enjoy cold, unpleasant, impersonal, uncaring, unfriendly, rushed staff that don't respect your mental health needs and who make you feel like a burden I absolutely do not reccomended Richmond General for surgery."

I waited another 2 hours before a nurse came in and told me to go home because all they had was one doctor on duty and they had more serious cases in front of me. So they wasted a total of 6hrs of my time and the entire night and early morning just to tell me this. My condition got worse when I got home so I went to VGH where the wait wasn't as long... only 3 hrs before a I saw a doctor who told me I needed surgery to repair an undiagnosed leaky heart valve.

The resident in training, Lindsay, was so kind and efficient as was the nurse who was helping her. The gals that took my ECG and bloodwork were also efficient and very kind. Doctor Mathew Kwok performed a portable ultrasound on my heart  in the hallway but went out of his way to find a portable privacy screen. Once again, he was super kind and efficient.

She said ""no I can't give any updates, and you can get all the info you want when she is awake if she feels like calling. You're disturbing us."" They decided to start taking it out on my mother, saying that her family is disturbing her. Overall These employees need a serious training session for serving their patients with compassion, care and making necessary tests. My mother told me she also saw an old addict whom was upset about the long wait time, he was not violent, disturbing or a threat. He was complaining about having to wait for longer than 6 hours.

They never once washed her hair, they never did anything more then a very basic sponge bath, they would leave food all over her face/chest for hours and she would go days before they sat her in her wheelchair (which was supposed to happen everyday for one meal).

Third day they put me in a room converted from walk in washroom, with no window and was left alone . No one came to see me even I was suffering and screaming with pain. I had no covid nor I had any symptoms. I still was isolated screaming in pain. Finally after screaming and crying for help nurse gave me injection. And next day I was relieved. Good thing I asked for relieve from there because that was the reason I am alive today. If I were stayed there another day I would’ve been dead by now. But thanks to one doctor who referred  me to specialist even there was waiting period. Even worse experience in VGH.  No one caref there . You can blame medical service, system or else. But at the end one can’t get away blaming system. It’s management, politicians or staff inside who is responsible.

Now today I needed some records and the woman in the records department was rude, unhelpful and the most unprofessional medical employee I've seen in a long time. Her explanations were all medical jargon using terms only employees would understand and upon requesting clarification she literally hung up on me and then refused to answer further calls.

After waiting for 1.5 hours in the waiting room, I was finally brought into a small room inside and was given a thin sheet to cover myself. I was waiting in the room wrapped by the thin sheet, frozen and shaking. During the course of one hour, NO ONE nurse came in to check how I was doing. I had to go out myself to ask for a thicker blanket and asked how long I had to wait more. A young nurse was very rude telling me this was the waiting time. Later on, an elderly nurse brought in a thick blanket. I was waiting for another 40 minutes before the doctor finally showed up. NO nurse came in again. The doctor spent no more than 4 minutes to check my illness and let me go. She told me the fever was caused by virus, nothing she could do. No explanation of what kind of the virus it's, no further exam, no medication, around midnight, I left the hospital. My lips were swelling, my fever was worse, the headache was killing me... I was wondering why I came to here at the first place, and why they even call here ""EMERGENCY""???

Isn't it the nurses' responsibilities to take care of the patients, instead of leaving them alone in a cold room? Isn't it the doctor's responsibilities to help the patient understand clearly of what's the problem they are having and give them sound advice of how to get better, instead of just saying taking care of yourself ???"

We went to the emergency. We waited for hours and hours to see the doctor. After the exams, the doctor said she had to stay in the hospital. But there weren't enough beds, she had to wait again for an empty bed. When we got an empty bed she stayed there for a little less than a week, then they said someone else needed this bed and they made her stay in the ICU waiting room until they had her new bed ready. When she got the new ""room"" I can't even believe that it's considered a room. It's just a bed. The space is so small even the nurse is having a hard time trying to get in. There's no emergency equipment, they have her a small desk bell in case she needed a nurse. In that room they had a vent where the fume and dust come out right on top of her head, it gave her bad anxiety. She told the nurse and they covered it with tape and cloth. I asked the nurse to change the room but she said that there are more than 10 people waiting at the emergency for a bed. The nurse and the doctors are really good, it's just the hospital overall. I hope someone will do something about this, but I doubt it. Not just for my wife, but for everyone in general. When I look at the reviews all I see are negative reviews."

The reason I didn’t rate you 1 star because the doctor I met was actually really nice, patient, helpful and really wanted to help.
I did receive some nice treatment from some nice stuff.
But not everyone, I’m not expecting to be treated like an VIP or what. But when a patient who can barely walk and could hardly speak is in front of you  and you just have to treat him/her in such bad attitude. That’s very unprofessional for me.

Heart attack, almost lost conscious, unable to move my muscles and squeeze my fingers after the heart attack at home. 2 things I wanna complain.
1. While I was lying in the portable bed waiting at the hall way of your hospital once I got into the hospital .  One of the nurse and the ambulance guy kept testing me if I can squeeze my fingers or not.  The answer is barely.  Then, another nurse not in white color spoke loudly and squeeze my left fingers hardly, and yelled ""I WANT YOU TO SQUEEZE YOUR FINGERS LIKE THIS! In fact, she hurt me, she squeezed so hardly on my fingers.  I was scared.  Due to Covid, only myself is there. The ambulance guy was there a few distance away. He should know who that nurse is. The answer is I barely can squeeze fingers after the attack.

2. I had Pfizer 1st dose on Jun 7, 2021.  I had dizziness since then.  On Jun 10, 2021, I even had increasing heart rate to a heart attack, almost passing out, and couldn't control my muscles.  The problem is Dr. WONG Deny it is related to Pfizer vaccine.  I went home and search online
There's tons of studies showing it and its even in government website. Dr Wong kept saying there's no evident showing increasing heart rate is related to pfizer vaccine.  That she is right and saying I can only give you a holster monitor.  Anxiety is another side effect from Pfizer as you can search on internet.  Dr. Wong noticed my heart rate bumps up whenever she talked with me, and I noticed even I walked, my heart rate bumps up quickly.  So she said she will give me some pills to calm me down.  Ironically, she is off.
Then, another Dr picked up and kick me out of hospital right away based on all my CT scan, etc are clean.  But did she really look at the file?  I asked what about the calm pills that Dr Wong promised? That new Dr said, it's your routine anxiety, you have to deal with it, even I gave it to you, it will come back! "". In fact, to my understanding, all this increasing heart rate and anxiety Lv are all from the pfizer vaccine.  You can go search online.  I m not the only one suffering from this. I know covid is hard for all Dr. And hospitals.  But it doesn't mean you can click out patients asap and not really understand their cases.  Even Dr Wong at first didn't know I was got in by ambulance, heart attack, almost passing out, til I talk about it.  Once I got back home. I called my GP in the next day.  He is so smart and he knows what's happening
He gave me appropriate medicine to treat my case correctly.  I can't believe this emergency hospital is trying not to save people. I have palpitation once in every 10 mins when I get back home and in the next day. This hospital is hopeless."

Received two discs on April 19th and one of them wasn't burnt properly so neither of my laptop or work computer could read it.  Called them back countless times - most of the time you have to leave a vm as no one would pick up the phone.  I was lucky to get my call answered once by Donna.  After a long battle of phone conversation with Donna, she agreed to re-burn the Echocardiogram disc and have their reception call me once it's ready for pick up.  It was April 27th.  I called back every week for followup but never got my phone or vm answered for the past 3 weeks.  I'm defeated.  The reason I asked for a copy is that my Dad is out of country and was diagnosed with either newly developed pulmonary embolism (blood clogs near heart veins that are connecting to the lungs), or pre-existing ones that you just have to live with for the rest of your life on medication.  If it was newly developed, the doctors will take aggressive treatment to have them dissolved within a short period of time; if it was pre-existing then aggressive treatment would not be appropriate as it will ultimately increase the risk of inner bleeding, especially for seniors.  So this is truly a life-death situation.  After this painful long battle with the Radiology reception, my Dad has missed the best timeframe for dissolving the blood clogs if it was newly developed and would have to live with short of breath and other painful symptoms for the rest of his life.  I know the doctors there are very responsible and make professional judgements and try to save lives and alleviate pain for their patients.  I do not understand why the admin side of the Richmond General Hospital is trying everything to achieve the opposite.   Do you have any idea how your negligence of your duties would impact people's lives, Donna?  Please do not abuse the authorization and power that granted to you by your role.  People's lives are at stake after all.  I am furious as this omission has done a permanent damage to my Dad's health, his longevity, and likely the quality of his retirement life.  I know for sure next time when Richmond General Hospital's charity donation event comes around, I would turn them down as I don't think I would support such staff and such behavior on top of my tax money.  In the meantime, I will seek legal consultation if my Dad's situation gets worse.

Recently our family has been to Richmond emergency dept multiple times for serious health issues. The doctors, nurses & clinical staff who works there are really awesome group of people. Hope the provincial government realize that there is a big demand for ER service due to the population growth & new immigrants. Current Federal Government brings people without much of forward thinking of the needs.

The Richmond ER needs funding to add more doctors and nurses.
The Nurses at the ER works extremely hard to find beds for everyone. They are so polite and saying to the patients that "" sorry we are trying to get you a bed ASAP"". In my opinion the Provincial & Federal government should give the necessary tools and facilities for these dedicated clinicians.
So they can focus on their jobs instead of looking for logistics.  Hope our current premier John Horgan & Minister of Health Adriam Dix help the healthcare professionals by properly funding the ER's & more beds for patients. Former liberal government was a disaster and they didn't do much for 14 years except privatizing some departments & we see the repercussions after many years. You can see it for yourself.

Final note , We should pay more to our nurses similar to other developed countries. Nursing is a very demanding and very stressful job. Plus we need more ER Physicians and open more positions for ER physians. Then pay a good salary. Thanks Richmond ER you guys are awesome. Keep up the good work"
