This hospital emergency room is full of compassion less robots that treat people like animals. Every staff gaslights you saying you are fine.  God forbid any of them ever get sick and need to seek help. This place is so disgusting and absolutely traumatizing for everyone that walks in there. Something needs to change here. I doubt it ever will.

Baker 3, room 313* , August 3.

Butcher, rude, unnecessary uses force, don’t listen you at all.
Butcher, rude, unnecessary uses force, don’t listen , rude asking you to shat up while you scream from pain this is a terribly unpleasant and unprofessional nurse, he twisted my hand so hard that I screamed from pain, my hand immediately turned blue and numb and just went limp and I couldn’t move it.  this is a terrible condition, since it is only an iv and the day before, the nurse inserted  IV without cruel metods of twisting my arms, she simply tied it with an elastic band and calmly placed the iv.   At the same time, he communicated very rude .  IV injected into the place, which now I can’t bend my arm since the needle is right on the bending part of wrist , I won’t be able to stand up usung ma hand or just use right hand until they take it off me.
Worsest part, he was laughing at me because he knew i can not do anything.
Nurse James, with beard, please be nice with people coming to you for help, don’t think you a God and you can do whatever you want.

it off iv."

And I know the rating on here wont get seen by the staff who went out of their way on multiple occasions but my experience there was always as efficient as it could be and staff seemed to be empowered to help as needed.

Specifically I went in there for a cancer treatment and was super freaked out and everyone who I interacted with from staff to surgeons were just so professional and kind. I cant say I recommend a hospital but the folks there must have to deal with a lot, but they do it with such a great level of care, youd never know.

Thank you staff folks - you were all so helpful."

While I’m certain the doctors and nurses were compassionate and hardworking, despite being overworked and short-staffed as all the hospitals in BC seem to be, the two weeks my uncle spent in that hallway were deeply disheartening. No patient should be in a position to deteriorate and pass away in a public space, deprived of any privacy throughout it all, nor should any family have to watch their loved one deteriorate and pass away in a public space, a hallway. This situation is not only distressing for the families themselves but also traumatic for other patients and visitors witnessing these moments.

Absolutely disgusting and our Provincial and Federal Governments should be ashamed of themselves!"

The last two times I've brought my daughter here they have forgotten about her and action was taken only AFTER I complained. 10hrs for something to stop the vomiting and no IV for fluids after days of dehydration. By the time they offered an IV we didn't feel like waiting for another 4 hrs for that to happen. Something needs to change, urgently."

After I was issued an ultrasound which I did not get sent into until 7pm when I was told the wait would be 20 minutes. The bed I was in was not cleaned, it had hair and snot/crust on the sheet as well as pee and used napkins in the bathroom of my room. There was also a man screaming for help for over 5 hours, nonstop as his genitals were exposed and he needed water. Every.single.staff member was just walking by ignoring him. In my next waiting room I was clumped in a small room with four other people, one of them having viral pneumonia that was not even three feet away from me. They had us all out on recliner chairs rather than real hospital beds in order to cramp as many people into a room as possible. Finally, they sent me out at 9pm after finding nothing in the ultrasound and telling me to come back for another 16 hr wait if my pain continues. I do understand our healthcare system seems to be at an all time low. All in all I will never be back, the patients are grossly neglected, the place is extremely uncleanly, understaffed and the waiting time is outrageous. I’ve never had this kind of experience in any hospital I’ve ever been to. Is this due to a lack of funding, a lack of doctors? Whatever it is, someone needs to get their shit together. We are taxed too much to have our infrastructure be so shot."
