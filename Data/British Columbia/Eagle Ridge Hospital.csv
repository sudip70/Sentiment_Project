Had to sit and wait and wait and wait while having internal bleeding.

The doctor left me in the middle of the conversation to grab an oxygen sensor as she couldn't get it to work. It took her over an hour and then she disappeared after and never returned. about 90 min later the next shift came in and finally saw a doctor. Entered at 7 PM and left 4 AM just to get some medications. I appreciate the fact they take time to check everything but this amount of wait time is brutal."

Wait time posted was 3.5 hrs. 6 hrs goes by but still can't see a doctor. They don't care whether you are struggling or having a hard time.

I was concerned about a possible serious condition and sought urgent medical help.

The attending physician performed an ultrasound to check for gallbladder stones, which came back clear, and told me there was no infection because I didn’t have a fever or vomiting. He then prescribed me antacids, which did not alleviate my pain. Additionally, my blood test results were not reviewed with me until I followed up with my family doctor two days later. My family doctor informed me that my CRP levels were elevated, indicating inflammation and likely a viral infection, which the rash on my skin confirmed.

Had the emergency doctor properly reviewed my blood test and recognized the signs of inflammation and infection, I could have received appropriate treatment earlier. Instead, I was left to suffer for several more days unnecessarily. This oversight significantly impacted my well-being and recovery.

I am extremely disappointed with the lack of thoroughness in the care I received. Patients should not have to follow up with another doctor to get accurate information about their health. I hope this review serves as constructive feedback to improve communication and diagnostic accuracy for future patients."

From the moment I arrived, I was met with such genuine care. Samantha, the nurse at check-in, was incredibly understanding about the pain I was in. It’s not often that you feel truly listened to in a busy hospital, but she made sure I felt supported.

Dr. Street was another standout. His calm and kind demeanor made me feel so much more at ease, almost like I wasn’t in an emergency room at all. His peaceful presence was just what I needed during a stressful time.

And I can’t forget to mention Ate Michelle. She was so warm and accommodating, and it was clear she genuinely cared. That special 'kabayan' connection she provided really made a difference in making me feel comfortable and at home.

I don’t often take the time to write reviews, but the kindness and professionalism I experienced at Eagle Ridge Hospital really stood out. They turned what could have been a difficult experience into one filled with compassion and care. Thank You!!!"

After reading several reviews, it seems that everyone's experience is truly dependent on the doctor assigned to them.

For us, we were fortunate with the doctor who came to help my dad - Dr. Josh K was great! He gave us my dad's diagnosis and clearly explained the next steps. He was also so kind, sympathetic, and very friendly. Thanks, Dr. Josh!

The nurses were ok. No one expects them to smile or be as polite as customer service professionals, but some of the nurses at the front desk can be quite rude even when the patient is being very clearly polite and friendly."

We have waited for about 6 hours, before we went to the nurse and begged her for someone to take a look or at least provide basic first aid. Or at least materials for the first aid. I thought I had to sew him up myself in an emergency room, that's how powerless and helpless we felt. No first aid was provided for the severe bleeding for 6 hours. After asking them to do something because he might loose his hand function, he was taken in. They did an xray, but doctor said it's blurry and she can't read it. But ""it's okay, we will assume open fracture"". As she was working on his hand, she mentioned she and only one other doctor is on duty today for the whole hospital, for a nightshift. She also was complaining how lucky my husband is to have the privilege to sick days. She said she doesn't have any sick days, and shows up sick to work. She said ""one time I was working on a patient and then had to step out to throw up in sink and continue to work"". Is that OK? For a doctor to be sick, and working in that condition on someone?? How unhygienic is it to throw up and then work on someone. Why would she even share this personal information with us, being exhausted from pain, my husband was already passing out from blood loss. It was nightmare experience. Our healthcare system is falling apart."

Instead, I was given a stack of papers, likely with the scan findings, but when I asked the nurse for an explanation from the doctor, I was told he had already left. I was simply instructed to go home.

They did send me home with pain medication, so it seems their focus was on pain management rather than providing answers. If you're looking for a thorough diagnosis and clear communication about your health, I would recommend seeking care elsewhere. While there was plenty of chatter among the nurses, I would have preferred more focus on patient care. I'll be trying a different hospital tomorrow."

I learned that there is more seniority with nurses here which means better shifts and less burn out than other hospitals. In my experience it equates to better patient care.

I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for the extraordinary care and compassion your team provided during our recent visit to the emergency room with my 2-year-old daughter, Selena.

Selena suffered a devastating burn accident, and understandably, she was in extreme pain and crying nonstop. From the moment we arrived, the front staff demonstrated incredible empathy and understanding. They immediately acknowledged our distress and did everything they could to help us feel supported during such a difficult time. Their professionalism and kindness were evident in every interaction, which was a great comfort to us as we navigated our daughter's emergency.

Despite a brief wait, the nurses frequently checked on Selena, offering anything they could to alleviate her pain, including popsicles and toys. They even took the time to comfort my husband and me, reassuring us and providing updates. Their attentiveness and genuine concern for Selena’s well-being were deeply appreciated.

We were promptly seen by Dr. Mk, who was nothing short of amazing. She immediately understood the urgency of managing Selena's pain before treating the burn on her hand. Dr. Mk provided detailed explanations about each step of the treatment, ensuring we felt informed and reassured. Her calm demeanour and compassionate approach were incredibly soothing during such a stressful time. Her ability to comfort Selena and us, while delivering top-notch medical care, was truly remarkable.

Three days later, we returned for a follow-up to have Selena’s dressing changed and her burn assessed. Despite Selena’s understandable anxiety about being back at the hospital, the staff remained patient and supportive. This time, we were seen by another Dr. MK, a male physician, who was equally exceptional. He showed great patience with Selena, carefully explaining each step to her and taking extra time to ease her fears. His dedication to her care included consulting with a plastic surgeon to ensure she received the best possible treatment. His thoroughness and kindness made a significant difference in our experience.

During our most recent visit, we were delighted to see the original Dr. Mk again. She greeted us with a warm smile and remembered us, which was incredibly comforting given the number of patients she sees daily. Her genuine happiness at seeing Selena’s burn healing well and her thoughtful advice for ongoing care deeply touched us. The fact that she remembered details about Selena and took such a personal interest in her recovery was truly heartwarming.

Dear Dr. Mk,
I can't adequately express how grateful we are for everything you've done. Your exceptional care and kindness made an incredibly traumatic and difficult time in our lives so much easier to bear. From the moment we met you, your empathy, patience, and professionalism shone through, providing us with comfort and reassurance during a very distressing situation.

Your dedication to managing Selena's pain and carefully explaining each step of her treatment gave us immense peace of mind. Your ability to connect with Selena and make her feel safe was truly remarkable. You went above and beyond to ensure she received the best possible care, and for that, we are profoundly grateful.

You are a wonderful doctor, and your compassion and expertise have left a lasting impression on our family.

My husband had to take the day off of work because he was feeling immense pain in some part of his body that had been bothering him for months but the night prior to our visit he couldn’t sleep from the pain. He called in sick and we went to the emergency hospital. We checked in at 9 am. There were only 4 people ahead of us. They kept taking people who walked right in before us. By 12:45 no one called for us, so we headed outside of the hospital to pick up a coffee order. We came back after 10 minutes where we were called into zone 2. While in zone 2, no one attended to us or spoke to us for 3 hours!!! Then a nurse came and said we have  been waiting the longest out of all the patients but because our situation isn’t an emergency we’d have to wait at least another 4 hours!! I was mad and said why they couldn’t inform us about this earlier instead of wasting our time. She said we could stay but it’ll take a very long time or we could leave. We left without saying a word to them. After an hour they called and said we had to come back immediately for blood work even though they said it’ll take another 4 hours. I just hung up on them. Do they think this is a funny joke?

Worse staff, horrible wait times, they won’t take you in unless you’re dying even then they probably wouldn’t take you in and this isn’t the first time this has happened. It happened to my father two weeks ago, an elderly man in his 70’s with a virus who had to wait for 6 hours before he was attended to. It happened to my mom who had heart pain a few years back and had to wait 5 hours.

Save yourself time and visit Royal Columbia hospital instead. Staff is so much better and wait time is much shorter."

I intended to go back to royal Columbian where I had been seen a couple of days earlier. I was seen by a male doctor at eagle ridge with white hair. On the way to the hospital the paramedic was thoughtful enough to give me something for nausea and a couple of Tylenol because when my arthritis and fibromyalgia start acting up I have a very hard time getting around.
The doctor that saw me did not hardly hear a thing I said and repeated all the blood tests and urine tests that had been done at royal Columbian two days previous.  With the same results. While I was there I was bringing my urine sample to the nurses station and I overheard a part of a conversation between the doctor that was “treating” me and the doctor at royal Columbian hospital. Thedoctor from eagle ridge had assumed I was there to get drugs and that I was faking an illness to get them. Obviously a very poor judge and what right did he have to assume anything about anyone? In fact he asked me if I had  gotten any drugs while I was there (wouldn’t I have had to get drugs through him?) He also put in writing that I am required to see my family doctor only when I’m sick and from now on if I want drugs I should talk to a pharmacist.  (I’m not sure who this guy thinks he is but he did put things in writing for me so I have that.
I left eagle ridge hospital just as sick as I was when I got there but I overheard a nurse telling that doctor that she thought I should have an ultrasound so I did that on Saturday morning and now will have to wait to see if my doctor bothers to phone me with results. I am even sicker now than I was and can’t go back to the hospital and be shamed again. I can assure you that I do not take “drugs” I’m a poor senior citizen with mobility issues who is very sick and now have no help.
You can also relax because I will never darken the door of eagle ridge hospital again!
Did I mention that I’m indigenous? Maybe a little race based judgement went on here. I’m not sure what the problem was but I have the proof and haven’t decided if I’ll pass it on yet. By the way I’m not very computer savvy so this is my friend Hannah’s phone. My name is Shellie."

However I was not to happy with a staff member when I arrived at 5:30 am a little early, I was told 6 am and when we figured out we had to enter next to emergency the young woman at the desk when we asked where to go to register seemed quite annoyed we interrupted her conversation with the other employee behind the desk.
I ended up walking back as there was no one at registration and I thought I may have been at the wrong area and now it was almost 6 am.
I really had her more annoyed for coming back and interrupting her conversation again she said it opens at 6 just take a number and sit.
I gave 4 stars only because of that young woman, everyone and everything else was great!

A nurse came out and said sorry and she understands because she had oral surgery!! How is that related to me and why do I care?  She said there were two critical patients before me. I don't mind that but it was a lie. They were all standing around laughing and eating pizza. This hospital is horrible and you won't receive help. Take a longer route and go somewhere else."

They used the excuse of the amount of people coming into the hospital because some other hospitals nearby were at full capacity as well to explain why they were loudly gossiping about patients behind the screen in the waiting room and ignoring people literally almost passing out from pain until almost every patient had to go up to their desks to complain about the treatment.
I was offered medication that I should not take as an eighteen year old, because you should not even be offering benzodiazepines to someone that young for a stomach ache. I was also asked multiple times if I wanted to take the specific medicine that they knew (as it was on my record and I kept reminding them) I had overdosed on and should not take again due to the risk of addiction that medicine posed and my medical history of substance abuse.
By the way, if you suffer from alcoholism or substance abuse you can expect the nurses and doctors to completely disregard your wellbeing and blame you for your condition.
A nurse that read my medical record and was told that I am autistic and suffer from anxiety told me to “just breathe” when I was about to pass out from hyperventilating due to my illness that day and the overstimulation in the hospital.
I waited for over twelve hours to be let into a room, where they did not give me an IV even though I was clearly dehydrated from the nonstop vomiting that led me to the hospital in the first place. They offered me the medicines I mentioned above and I refused, having to explain to real life doctors why an eighteen year old with a history of substance abuse should not be prescribed benzos. Then, I waited for the one doctor they had who was busy with a single patient for over four hours to come talk to me. She said that I would have to go to a gynaecologist and then proceeded to show me the gigantic metal tool they use. I was never given an explanation as to why she said that. It made my anxiety skyrocket though.
I asked another nurse where she had gone because it had been a while and it was a new day, so I just wanted to go home at that point as I noticed that I was not going to get any help from this hospital. The nurse gave me attitude and asked me if I think that she’s responsible for everything in the hospital running perfectly, in different words which I do not recall, but the same meaning.
When the doctor came back, she said that my lower abdomen internal pain and nonstop vomiting was “probably because of all the weed” and said I should just stop smoking. This was hilarious and aggravating at the same time. I had already briefly talked to a different male doctor during the night and he explained to me the disorder that is associated with how much THC i had been smoking daily for years and he was much better at explaining it.

Thank you for nothing. I hope this hospital eventually becomes as neglected as their patients. I would be glad to see this place under a completely new management, but I would also be happy to see it disappear entirely."

I went to the hospital on Feb 15th at 8am because I was experiencing very very painful heart palpitations type feeling.  I went there and they took me quite quickly, this was a positive and initial nurse was nice she took my details and told me to wait in the area.  Then an Eastern European accented, male nurse behind the triage called me over and asked me what is wrong with me.  I said the night before I was feeling a lot of chest pains in the heart.  He then said that have you had this before?  And I said yes I did and I came in to ER for it.  He said then cheekily ""do you see the problem with what you just said?""  He went on and said ""The ER is meant for people who are ALMOST dying you are fine and this is not an emergency."" I sat there for a second perplexed as to what this person just said to me.  Here I am almost panicking thinking I have a heart problem because of my chest pains and he is telling me I am just making it up.  Absolutely disgusting feeling when someone you come to for help talks to you like that.

I have already filed a complaint about this situation with the Fraser Health and I will further follow up.  On a side note the doctor who took me in was really kind and helpful.  It is just sad that there are people like this person who work there.  I will follow up with a complaint on this specific person who should not be tending to people coming in."

And every time we asked to see how long is left. They gave us so much attitude saying that they’re short staff and they’re frustrated. No other answer . If you guys are short staff maybe instead of the millions you spend to make the waiting room bigger and make the “EMERGENCY ROOM “ which is just the room of death Look fancy should invest that money on hiring some nurses and doctors so the humans can actually get help in shorter period of time. People lives are in danger that’s why they’re at hospital. Meanwhile I was there they called the police on 2 patients and just kept making the “EMERGENCY ROOM”  more and more stressful for the patients and their families

I would say that this hospital is neither worse nor better than all the others in our province where I have been. The doctors and nurses are trying to do their best, but there are a lot of inexperienced nurses, and I wouldn't want anyone to have to deal with them. . I think the problem lies not with the medical staff as a whole, but with the system and the training. Many highly qualified medical professionals come from other countries, but not everyone is able (due to financial reasons) to have their diplomas recognized. As a result, this is what we end up with—shame and disgrace, in general. I am from a poor country, but I have never seen medicine like this before.

I want to note something about Glen Levers—he is a Respiratory Therapist. Here lies the problem:  people like him should not work in medicine. I have never seen such an attitude towards patients in my life. If someone from the Eagle Ridge authorities reads these reviews, please pay attention to this individual. His communication and understanding of patients, as well as his knowledge, are appalling. He was taking care of a palliative patient, and his behavior was shocking. He was rude, he dropped the oxygen insert onto the floor that was supposed to go into the patient's nose, and instead of replacing it, he started cleaning it. When we pointed this out to him, he became more aggressive and started saying that he would not help and that he would not let this palliative patient stay in the hospital. Even the doctor who was in the room had to intervene.

It has been over a year since this incident, but it is still fresh in my mind as if it happened yesterday. When I told him, ""Shame on you, this patient is dying, show some humanity,"" he replied, ""Nobody knows how long we are going to leave. This person shouldn't even be in the hospital, but if he is, the maximum access for him , is a laundry room. But even that is questionable."

I am not surprised though as this hospital is notoriously known as the worst in the lower mainland. Unfortunately it is the closest for many people who have literally no choice to come there, but what a mistake. They claim ''working out the kinks'' of their new ER department is the reason they are slow, or ''short staffed'', well whoever is in charge of the ER Department should plan better for these types of things, after all its an EMERGENCY room. I went in with a heart episode and had to leave SIX hours later because I couldn't wait any longer and my heart had calmed down by then. People who came in AFTER me were seen within an hour with a broken or fractured bone. They claim to see patients based on priority but that is absolutely false. The receptionists are cold hearted and should choose a better suited profession. I get the nurses and doctors are doing what they can, and I am grateful for that. But whoever is in charge, and the triage receptionists need to go and bring in people who are better suited for those positions. I get it, there's going to be bad reviews of every ER department, but it literally cant get any worse than this place. Be better prepared because someone is going to lose their life WAITING, due to your incompentence."

I was discharged on May 3, 2924.

During my stay I was seen almost immediately by Dr. Brendan Arnold, after which time Dr. Morley admitted me. I stayed the next 24 hours in bed 4 in Zone One of the ER and had exceptional care from Zuki, Amanda, Kay and especially Simona. At 11 pm on the 1st of May I was moved upstairs to the cardiac MCU. Throughout my entire stay I had multiple ECGs, chest X-rays, bloodwork, continual heart monitoring, blood pressure and oximeter readings. I also had an echocardiogram. Seeing one’s heart on a screen is an experience I won’t soon forget.

On May 2 at 7:30 am I was taken by ambulance to RCH to have an angiogram and angioplasty, after which time I returned to ERH. My nurses Elena, Lily and Cat in MCU were also wonderful.

After being admitted my physician was Dr. Ben Beheshti. Eagle Ridge Hospital is very fortunate to have such a wonderful doctor on their team. His knowledge and kindness was so wonderful. When you are suddenly faced with the reality you have heart disease, it is a physician of Dr. Beheshti’s calibre and personality you really want on your team. Thank you Dr. Beheshti

I was discharged on May 3, 2024 by Dr. Beheshti. Throughout I was extremely pleased with the wonderful care I received. I cannot thank each and every one enough.

Last night, May 4, 2024, I returned to ERH with a shortness of breath and weakness and I was immediately given a cubicle once again in Zone One of the ER. Between 9 pm and 5:30 am on May 5. I had an IV, my heart was constantly monitored, as were my blood pressure and oxygen levels. I had bloodwork x3, two chest X-rays, an ECG and Dr. Kathryn Toews gave me a thorough examination. She explained everything to me and even went the extra mile by bringing in a portable ultrasound machine to echo scan my heart. The good news is that my heart is fine. I did not have another heart attack; it was one of my medications causing the issues which has now been stopped and a new one prescribed. I am very happy to give both Dr. Beheshti and Dr. Toews five stars. Finally, last night my nurse was Mike. Thanks Mike! I appreciate you.

If you add all the visits I have had together to this hospital in total it would be around 25 times. I know the doctors by name.
Unfortunately this hospital staff is very unprofessional and lack treating patients right with respect. They look at people as a number. That is most of them but not 100% because some are amazing and love their jobs, but those ones don't stay because the culture and the management of this hospital is very different from what their values are.
I have just waited for a long time before I review this hospital but today was a breaking point. So a very close family member of mine called me and I drove her there. They first of all didn't have wheelchairs and we needed a wheelchair and I asked the staff they said we don't know and passed me to other individuals.
The person in the front were you check in first didn't even look at me in the eye for once and it felt like she was just a robot. And we checked in and she got a bed after 45 minutes which is super uncommon because the waiting times are insane in this hospital... I won't continue the story because I want to make a point.

Here is the point: the health care system in Canada is the problem (the structure of it). Because it is free and the patients don't pay directly to them, it makes the structure of doing business at the hospital in a way that the staff no longer care about the patient because no matter what they are getting paid, the management doesn't care because no matter what they are getting paid, therefore there is no competition and it makes this happen in the hospital that the management don't care about what people say and I'm 100% sure that Eagle Ridge Hospital management doesn't look at their google rating because if they looked at it they would see that everyone is mad and angry with the service that they provide."

My mom went there and was there for 3 weeks during Christmas. I asked for an update from the doctor regarding my mom’s situation and he immediately was on defence and got mad. Told me “I don’t know what to tell you!!! It is what it is!” I didn’t know what he was even talking about BECAUSE HE NEVER TOLD ME WHAT THE PROBLEMS WERE. I was shocked and disgusted at his bedside manner when I was only asking for a simple update about my mom. My mom was released prematurely and 3 weeks later she ended up dying of high co2 blood gases. If the doctor had explained this to me weeks ago I could have had a conversation with my mom if I had known how severe her situation was. Now I will never get that chance. I’m sure there were amazing nurses there they always work so hard but the doctor was a sad excuse for a human being. Thanks doc."

Little did I know, I'd be embarking on a journey through the depths of waiting room purgatory. Despite arriving promptly at 8:30 pm, it took a whole hour just to be triaged by a single nurse who seemed to be operating on island time. By the time I was ushered into an exam room at 2:30 am, I was convinced I'd aged a decade. But wait, there's more! The pièce de résistance was waiting until 4:20 am for the doctor to grace me with their presence. Shockingly, they seemed perplexed when I revealed I hadn't received any painkillers during my interminable wait. Talk about adding insult to injury!

Upset because not sure what’s causing pain. I’m told it could be irritated nerve but you need CT scan for that and that you’ll be able to schedule after 4-6 weeks of pain. Yes, prescribed painkillers, no don’t want to get hooked. 77 years and will bear pain for 4-6 weeks. Understand CT scans expensive or not available but not my problem as I pay taxes 60k a year and wonder why they don’t give more to health care and instead spend on garden revamping and other non-essential. Yes pretty upset.

Why 4 stars- above issue not to do with hospital but I want someone to remember this. Also, you cannot take pictures of your X-ray so if you are planning next day walk in ask to referral to Port Moody urgent care, they have access to your hospital records apparently.

So these two issues took away one star because I still don’t know the cause of unbearable pain and feel bewildered by the system which doesn’t make sense to me sometimes.

I know nurses and doctors are trying their best almost as if it goes on their score card but I really want someone to make a change to the CT scan system.

Parking don’t use hangTag or you pay every hour which amounts to a lot if whole day. Instead pay with credit card at entrance for whole day parking till 6 which option hangTag doesn’t have.

Anyway the nurses ensure people are not standing too long in queues before helping them. There was someone to guide people getting lost as we were leaving. That would have been helpful as we were enterin. The guest services had a lineup when we arrived.

Anyway, the nurses are kind and helpful. I didn’t feel uncomfortable there and overall things are bright and well organized at cardiology and emergency. Yes I’ve visited both at different times. I still love this hospital staff.

Two hours to meet doctor, one for X-ray, one more for doctor and I lost count of where the missing hour went. Overall Sunday and got assured no fracture. So good."

The whole point of triage is to set a priority of care. People complaining about wait times, ""the nurses are just standing there"", ""there are empty beds"", ""patients who came in hours after me are being seen first"" - how about let's educate you guys on how the ER department works. You walk in the entrance, you get seen by a healthcare professional who's trained to tell whether or not, you, at that point in time, are dying/are in a very concerning state/you're sick, but other's are more sick. Those of you complaining with pain, nausea, dizziness and are saying ""oh that person has the same symptoms as me and they got here hours after, why do they get to go first."" Let me break it to you, 99% of the time, just because you had the same (visible) symptoms, does not factor in the pts history, their story, other presentations you might not be aware of, or other things the healthcare provider (triage) assessed. For example, were you aware that this patient who ""had the same symptoms as you"" possibly had an underlying condition like DM2, afib, DLD, etc.? No. These conditions can make you more susceptible to fatality. Now let's explain how the flow of the system works. The nurses + hcas will call a patient up based on priority. Patient get's their name called and will be taken to a room where they now wait for the doctor to come in and assess them. After this assessment (varies by patient), you will then be asked to be seated outside by the nursing station to wait for the results (if you took any tests) and the doc will then speak to you about the results and move on from there. Now keep in mind. I'm only explaining how zone 2 works. The ED has 2 more zones, being zone 1 (high acuity - cardiac, respiratory patients [20 beds]) and zone 3 where we put patients who need to be admitted and are just waiting for a bed upstairs. Whenever you see the nurses ""sitting around, not calling anyone"", look to see how many doc's are doing rounds at that specific point in time (zone 2). Let me tell you now, there's either 1 doc or no doc doing rounds. They're most likely attending to a trauma, or doing rounds in our higher acuity zone (z1). So how can the system keep up with the overflow with one/no doc doing rounds? If this happens, nurses can't be calling in new patients when there's no doc in the zone. That's what causes the hold up. Now, yes I get it, you're sick, you're not feeling well, you're their to get better. Unfortunately, the system is messed up and has been ever since post-covid. I'm seeing a lot of negative comments about the nurses but please try to put yourselves in their shoes. There's 100s of people going through the door everyday, some are nice, some are ***holes, on top of this, continuous monitoring of 25+ patients with only 3-4 nurses in a high acuity environment dealing with some patients who don't even speak English, are drug users, alcoholics, and so much more. People need to understand that they are constantly under physical and mental abuse. I'm not condoning disrespectful behavior to patients, I'm completely against it. However, I do see the turmoil they go through every single day. I'd want to become a nurse to help and heal people, however, if I knew the true state our healthcare system was in now, and the abuse that comes along with it, I wouldn't choose this career in a million years.

Fix: More available positions. More DOCS, More Nurses.

Also, please understand that eagle ridge hospital is a small community hospital. With the increase in developments results an increase in population. This also plays a big role in the influx of patients that come to this specific ED, thus, healthcare providers can't keep up with patient intake in a timely manner, especially with this shortage of staff."

Never in my life have I ever been treated this horribly as a patient in a hospital. I felt unsafe and uncomfortable, will not be returning. It was unbelievable how inhumane patients were treated, absolutely no empathy or kindness in the words or actions of these nurses. I arrived at 3 pm today with lots of pain but no fever. (I developed one afterwards) I arrived and waited until I saw that everyone before me and EVERY BODY that came after me was getting called in first. It was unbelievable. At that time I was alone and needed a place to charge my phone. After 7 hours, even though the waiting time was 3, I was called into zone 2. Prior to being let in, I watched in pain as everyone before me headed inside, even people who had walked in hours after me. I understand emergencies but the person beside me was feeling the same way as I did and as soon as they developed a fever (they tested their own) they got up and told the counter and they got called in immediately after. Did I need a fever to be let in and be seen and heard????? I developed my fever shortly after but apparently it was not high enough and I was being let in after my assigned waiting time.

I was in the waiting room for 7 hours, I witnessed multiple negligent and careless actions of the nurses. A woman who entered and was in great pain almost unconscious was waiting with the help of her husband. When this woman got called, the nurse came out of the door and said “come here” to the family. This was the first time that they had met. I found that such a mean way to guide a patient inside. What happened to “hello” “ma’am” “sir”. Many others were concerned about their treatment and waiting time, as they stood up to catch any nurses coming through to ask them, the nurses completely disregarded and ignored them. I saw that the the only point where you got one of them to speak to you was if a patient literally stood in front of them. When asked about the wait time, these nurses responded so terribly in ways that I felt embarrassed and scared to even speak to them. THAT IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD FEEL TOWARDS OUR NURSES, THOSE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OF AID TO US. I saw that these nurses were short tempered and I felt so degraded trying to talk to them.

Another thing about the nurses was that the names they called out were half the time wrong. They were not able to pronounce many many common names. People had to get up and confirm if they were calling their names or not. For me, I had 2 names that were said super closely to mine. When they were calling me, they called the wrong but similar name. Once no one stood up for the wrong name they called, I went towards them and asked if it was me that they were looking for, sure was.

The only person who was kind to me this day was my doctor. I applaud her for having empathy towards me and treating me with care and kindness.

One characteristic that I noticed a lot with the nurse that treated me afterwards was impatience. She brought me my medicine and it felt like I was someone begging her to answer my two simple questions. I just asked her “can I gurgle some salt water” she responded “yeah whatever” and left. I was in utter shock. I asked a total of two short questions, when I finished my first one, this nurse was on her legs ready to run away from me and go somewhere else. Patients should not feel rushed when asking questions or being treated. When I was asking my second question, I noticed her impatience and said “one more question please I’m so sorry”. I should not be feeling the need to apologize.

With my medicine, they brought me cold water, absolutely disregarding the reason I came to the hospital and the fact that cold water would truly be my worst enemy at that moment and to the way that I was feeling.

Overall, my doctor was kind to me however the nurses were not. Please be kinder next time."

She’s informative, patient with our 2 year old and agreed to see us right away.

1 star for the hospital. We came from an urgent care clinic (Port Moody) with a referral to rule out appendicitis. When we got here, the line up were 2 people waiting only. The nurse at the check in, asked us not to feed our child. I understand that. But do you expect a toddler not to eat for 4-5 hours? By this time we already have 2 hours wait time from the urgent care. I am 8 months pregnant and my toddler is sick.

I have been a nurse in my home town and the least thing you can do is prioritize this child who has a referral from the urgent care. The nurse at the check in piled all the charts and waited until it was full and went inside. We finally got called in after 2 hours wait from the check in.mind you we already had a referral letter.

My son was hungry and were told not to eat, but I was a RN back home and I kept giving my son ice chips which obviously the nurses were too lazy to think of (a solution).

We waited for another 3 hours until my husband arrived and wanted to take us home or try RCH because Eagle Ridge facility is useless.

Clean facility but most are inconsiderate health workers except the 2 ladies today.
I hope there will never be a time that we have to come back here. Our healthcare system needs a full make over."

Bloodwork and urine tests came back fine and they were going to send her home, until she showed the Nurse the requisition from our Family Dr. which also included a stool sample and a CT Scan. They did the CT Scan which showed something abnormal in her colon so the Dr. on duty decided to admit her and provide her with a weekend pass to go home that Friday, remain on a liquid diet, take antibiotics and pain killers, and return on Monday, for the colonoscopy prep, etc.

I will be forever grateful to Dr. Ali Abdalvand for making the decision to admit her to Hospital.

My daughter returned to Emergency on Sunday because she was feeling much worse. The staff were not pleased at all with Dr. Ali Abdalvand's decision to provide her the weekend pass (their comments clearly overheard by my daughter). The Emergency Dr. on duty that Sunday night minimized her symptoms, making her feel that coming to hospital for ""tummy pain"" was not appropriate. My daughter was told there were no notes regarding returning on Monday to prep for a colonoscopy, etc. The Emergency Dr. was prepared to discharge her and then send her home with something to help her with her dizziness. Thankfully one of the Nurses came across the clear notes previously written by Dr. Ali Abdalvand. My daughter was then admitted to Hospital.

Had it not been for my daughter showing our Family Dr.'s requisition the first night at the Hospital, her persistence and self advocacy, she would have been discharged that Thursday or that Sunday and would not have returned to Hospital, waiting months for the CT Scan, as an out patient.

The results of the colonoscopy clearly showed a growth that turned out to be colon cancer and my daughter was transferred to Royal Columbian Hospital for the surgery to have a large part of her colon and the growth removed, along with lymph nodes.
Had she been ignored, and discharged home, this could have gone on for months and months and would have been a worse case scenario.

This is not the first time this Hospital attempted to discharge my daughter when something was clearly wrong. A couple of years ago she went to Emergency with ear inflammation and severe tinnutis and they refused to do a COVID test. Turned out she had a bad case of COVID.

ALWAYS SELF ADVOCATE, BE PERSISTENT, AND ALWAYS HAVE SOMEONE WITH YOU TO ADVOCATE FOR YOU, TO TAKE NOTES."

I've never been treated that badly as when I tried to speak with the cardiology team at Eagle Ridge Hospital. Dr. Leang is an amazing specialist with excellent communication skills, but his assistant is a nightmare. Every time I tried to speak to her, she interrupted me. During the last call, when I attempted to clarify the information (because the information she provided me with differed significantly from what I received from another specialist), she started yelling at me. I was completely shocked. I would appreciate it if the facility could teach their workers how to communicate effectively with others. We pay taxes to support the healthcare system, and it's not free. Nobody should be treated the way I was treated during my call with Dr. Leang's assistant.
On the other hand, the treatment I received in the emergency department was wonderful. They took great care of me from the moment I arrived until the diagnosis was made, and their job was well-done!
I would like to express my gratitude to the emergency department at Eagle Ridge Hospital because they diagnosed an uncommon disease and helped me proceed with its treatment."

We spent about an hour in the waiting room before a nice nurse saw us, and that my daughter was uncomfortable so she put us in a room right away. I feel like everyone was a bit skeptical she broke her arm because she was calm and wasn’t crying,  but once the x-rays (the x-ray technicians were so wonderful and lovely by the way, giving her stickers, making her feel comfortable, so compassionate), came back that she indeed broke it, the level of care was excellent. Right away they got her hooked up to an IV so they could straighten her arm and cast it. Everything was seamless and well organized, and a very clean hospital. Appreciate the good care once our results came in."

They were polite, courteous, and attended to me when I came in with severe back pain and trouble breathing. The nurses gave me a tablet of Tylenol and hydromorphone, which helped take the edge off. So for them, I give 5 stars. Great senses of humour, too. I wish I could give them 5 stars alone. But, the following medical professional deserves one star, hence the overall 3 star review.

However, I was seen by Doctor Brown (Brown hair, glasses, tall, 30s), which was not a pleasant experience. I was told that my blood work and x-ray came back okay, and it appeared that I had a horrendous muscle spasm. When I was told this, I asked about potential medications that could be prescribed should the spasms come back, as I have scoliosis and back pain is already bad enough as it is for me. I showed him a message from a family member who is an active paramedic, who listed Vimovo (anti-inflammatory) and Cyclobenzaprine (muscle relaxant). In the message, the family member correctly said they would have likely given me hydromorphone (a controlled narcotic).

When I showed Doctor Brown this, asking for Vimovo or Cyclobenzaprine, he said he already gave me a narcotic and that he wasn't giving me any more. I repeated that I wasn't asking for narcotics, I wanted muscle relaxants to help my back. He then told me that the Tylenol I took before I arrived (which did not help me) and tried to leave. I clarified by asking if he was telling me he wasn't going to prescribe me any medications, and he said he wouldn't give me anything and to go home. He also claimed that Cyclobenzaprine was an anti-psychotic, and then tried to leave again. I asked him if I was being discharged, and he said yes without looking at me and walked away.

Not only was I visibly upset by this, but a patient near me was also upset at this interaction. This was the first time I've ever had a bad interaction with any medical professional at an ER in my life. Where the nurses made me feel cared for and attended to my needs with professionalism, Doctor Brown was cold, dismissive, gave incorrect information, assumed I was trying to get narcotics despite me asking for anti-inflammatory medication, and left abruptly.

While this review will be seen by a few dozen, maybe more, I will be calling in to submit a formal complaint as well. No patient should be treated like this, and I hope that the hospital is made aware of Doctor Brown's lack of professionalism and dismissive behaviour.

Again, the nursing staff: absolutely fantastic, and you can rest assured that they will take care of you.

If you are seen by Doctor Brown, I encourage you to insist on being seen by another doctor."

I feel like generally the staff are quite nice here but today, in imaging, there was lady that was quite rude.

On top of the rude I’m against person, at checkin we were told that a porter will come by to either take us or let us know to go into imaging for an X-ray. When asked how long it would take she said around 30mins.

We waited for over an hr and no one came so I went up to the check in desk and let her know that no one had come. She checked the system and let me know to take my sister to imaging because there was a message saying that we needed to go ourselves.

Good thing I checked!!! Because after we came back from imaging the porter came about 10 mins then after asking us to go to imaging. But I noticed that two people before us had already been called - meaning we could have missed our name being called and would have had to wait longer 😒"

People working in the er not paying attention to what's going on
Heart patient with 2 stents and hour and 45 before I got a ecg
If I was having a heart attack I'd be dead. When I had my heart attack I was seen in a rural town of 1000 people  in 10 mins and ivs hooked up troponin tests done and  l knew I was having a heart attack within 20 mins, they saved my life with fast action and proper triage and caring people who understand the immediate nature of my situation and excellent staff with brains.
If you wanna die or risk death go-to eagle ridge hospital.
I'm told they have the highest mortality rate of all greater vancouver hospitals and I can see why. Very poor health care, and disrespectful staff and Dr's
One dr came into my room and said your blood work looks great. The trouble is I hadn't had any blood work done yet, and he says, oh give me a minute I must of looked at old blood work. And this guy is a er dr and can't read or didn't take the time to read. Shame on Eagle Ridge Hospital and their operations.
I have been wIting for my second troponin test in waiting room 2 zone  2. The er only has 1 er dr tonight and she is pathetic. I have watched her chat to the nurses in er for 1.5 hours and has seen 2 patients. The waiting g room is full of patients and she's been telling everyone about her vacation starting Sunday and that she's going to New York with her partner on the red eye and they are going to central park Yada Yada Yada. There isn't a staff shortage we have a a bunch  of incompetent people with zero idea on how to multi task and treat patients with respect and speed.
Shame on this facility and shame on this Dr. How dare she sit there and shoot the breeze with her colleagues for hours while patients wait in the waiting room in various states of distress. I will file a complaint with the college of physicians and surgeons and regardless of their likely biased findings it will stay on her record for her career. Now she's talking about her air fryer, and how great they are. What a joke. Incompetent Dr.
I've been here since 11:00 pm and in zone 2 since 12:00am since 1:00 not one patient has been moved from zone 1 to zone 2 and this dr hasn't seen more that 2npatients in 3 hours, what an absolute joke. Now the er waiting time on the computer says 5.5 hours give me a break the college of physicians and surgeons better do something about this absolutely wrong and playing with people's lives."

However, what I experienced was far from what one would expect from a reputable healthcare institution.

First and foremost, the waiting time was nothing short of outrageous. I was informed upon arrival that there was a substantial backlog of patients, and I would have to wait my turn. Little did I know that ""waiting my turn"" meant enduring a mind-numbing, agonizing ordeal that lasted for a minimum of 8 hours. It is unacceptable and inconceivable that individuals seeking immediate medical assistance should have to endure such interminable delays.
The sheer inefficiency and lack of regard for patient care were evident from the moment I stepped foot into the ER. It quickly became apparent that the staff was overwhelmed and ill-prepared to handle the number of patients requiring attention. The waiting area was filled to capacity, with people in various states of distress and discomfort, all forced to endure the agony of interminable waiting."

On October  27th yesterday evening around 7pm, My Fiancé and I entered Eagle ridge hospital emergency room for treatment of a painful Ear.
The emergency room was empty.  We waited for two hours while in excruciating pain,  the workers instead of taking care of us there were Chatting about their love story and Showing their phone to each other, Laughing and Massaging each other shoulders . (Non responsible reaction to the patients )
After 2 hours of waiting which for the empty emergency it was so long waiting time, they called us inside. First of all the room was not ready "" Marlin or Marlen '' was an Asian lady she took us to the room 28 and somebody told here room is occupied, she took us to room 26 then with in a 20 second she said go back to room 28 them again another resident said no they can not go to that room..... with all the confusion she took us to room 26.  At 9:30 the resident doctor I think his name was '' Josh or Joshua '' he was young Canadian guy, he was so nice and looks responsible, he sent my fiancé for CT and he told us he will give him prescription "" the spray to wash his sines till we go to visit ear specialist "". By the time we get a CT result he finished his shift , We hopped he pass my fiancé information to another resident.
( No Communication between the workers )

Unfortunately it was not our night last night at Eagle ridge hospital. I think the lady was helping us  "" Marlin or Marlen ''  an Asian lady, needs to practice more abut how to put on an IV for patients. She put the needle 3 times in my fiancé hand and dropped the stuff on the floor.
( Unsensitized work, Carelessness and Lack of experience )
Anyway she came to remove the IV and I asked her about CT result she was not sure she said she think it was ok and I asked here about prescription she said doctor Dr: Koczerginski, Joshua forget (he looks responsible I don't know why he forget),  then I went to desk and asked for the prescription tall resident the Attend Dr, Dictate Dr : Siu, William W.Y he yelled at me and said go have a site instead of answering my questions. (they said he has my fiancé information)  but he left, he did not back to give us prescription I saw him running away from other hallway he did not came to talk to us I asked about his name  workers scared to give me his name they said we are not allowed to give Doctor's names to patients which was unacceptable.
Finally I found the doctors info on the referral letter. The workers Instead of listening to us and taking care of my fiancé they called security and I don't know why. We were talking with low vice with them, really politely and respect other patients in a hospital,  we only asked for prescriptions, the result of CT and the resident name which I believe was our right to ask. ( Lack of responsibly and disrespect the patients from the resident doctors )
My point is why the second resident, Dictate Dr : Siu, William W.Y  (Non responsible person, A future doctor) yelled at me and why he did not come back to give us a prescription?
Do you think this is the way they should act with patients in a hospital?
We are educated people and at our regulars job we are doing customer service and we know how to talk to people to make them happy, but in this case we are not customer and the doctor is not doing the customer service a doctor has some responsibility for the patients. We know how to yells and we could yelled at him too, but we respect other patients and the hospital rolls. I hope you get my point.  ( Disrespectful behavior and Ignoring a patients )"

It’s kind of heartbreaking when I meet an obviously talented and seemingly dedicated physician dutifully labouring beneath layers of idiot bureaucrats and crooked politicians…. I showed up with a gaping laceration on my body, and Dr. Choi put on a master class in trauma care when stitching me up.  She was skilled and efficient, our brief interaction being not but 10 minutes long; but the process of getting to her was agonizing.  A waiting room clogged up with headaches, sniffles and limb pains; I watched the triage nurse attempt to explain what constitutes an emergency to several exasperated immigrant families and elderly patients without primary care physicians.  The guy who stumbled in with half of a finger - now THAT is an emergency.  The staff do the best they can within the god-awful system pencil pushers have cobbled together.  The doctors and nurses get 5 stars, the socialized medical system gets -2 stars!  BC has a bureaucracy problem and an NDP problem, not a health care problem."

I physically could not stay sitting up and laid down on my blanket on the floor, then the nurse pinched my neck really hard and screamed at me to get up and sit in my chair.

The fact they were even alive brought visible pain to her face as she reluctantly called them up one after another. She asked every question with a tone of anger, and when they responded, that anger would only increase. I had been waiting for several hours (despite having heart issues) and was able to hear every single one of her miserable interactions.

The covid setup was rather amusing as they had plexi glass to seperate those being admitted on the sides but none behind or front where people were sitting inches away. The quarantine area for those with covid symptoms was located at the back of the waiting room so those potential covid super spreaders had to walk through the non-covid patients to enter and to leave. They also weren't given clear directions by the angered nurse, this resulted in them mixing in with the regular patients. Like losing a friend in a large crowd.

Due to confusing directions by the admission nurse and intake nurse a patients Mom stepped up and started politely directing patients where to go and sit, after some time she jokingly quipped ""I might as well be working here."" Those of us in ear shot all laughed, a much needed respite from the general negative atmosphere created by staff. Eventually she left after her mother was admitted and the waiting room again collapsed into disarray as no one had the energy or motivation to fill her void, including myself.

After the 4 hour wait the attending doctor was friendly and nice. Likewise the nurse who took my blood was also quite sweet. For those reasons I elevated my rating from a one to a two."

He said we'll just do a dressing and follow up with a plastic surgeon in 3 days.
Asked him if he would give her the tetanus shot because she has an open wound and he said there's no need which was so shocking to me.
Something he should have known already.
Then had to remind him to give her a pain killer and IV before she passed out.
Again something he should have done automatically.

Finally after almost another hour a nurse came to put some dressing on the wound after so long of being in pain and worrying about getting an infection.
Without disinfecting and properly cleaning the wounded area first, she just started to put Polysporine and covered it sooo so poorly like it was her first time ever and was not trained for it and it all fell off by the time we got home... and ended up with an open wound again.

Basically we went to the hospital for nothing and wasted our whole day in there for some unprofessionals to get paid for not doing there job right.

Don't waste or risk your life by going to this hospital.
I'd rather drive an hour away to RCH or elsewhere than here."

Guess how many minutes for a broken elbow and concussion he had to sit and wait? 40 minutes..... then to make everything more painful for us . We got a parking ticket since I paid my parking fee a bit late . Clearly people at ER section are distressed and emotional . This is very inhuman and very cruel . They didn’t even let me dispute my ticket . Horrible , horrible . The Doctor released him and avoided to X-ray my husbands neck , even though he had a lot of pain,now he can’t even move his neck
. Would you people please have some sense of integrity . I would never let any one I know set foot in there ."

The wait wasn't very long as it was in the morning, and the front desk was very polite. However, the doctor I met was completely incapable, as he assured me that I didn't have any ligament damage, and my bones were fine. He did not say anything else helpful on what to do and what not to do. He said that I should be back in around 2 weeks. My family doctor, the same day, inspected the knee and said that there was definitely some ligament damage. Then I got a MRI, and it turns out I completely tore my ACL. I was baffled by how poor the examination of a professional doctor at this hospital was. Never going here again, it is worth it to drive to Royal Columbian."

My mother just had surgery there on her neck and the care that received was barely adequate to deserve the title of it. She was left in severe pain for almost the entire night with no one checking on her but that wasn’t even the worst of it!

Here is the worst of it.

She was put into a room with 3 other patients. Not usually a big deal, except that 2 of them were supposed to be in ISOLATION FOR HIGHLY INFECTIOUS DISEASES!!

We will be contacting the Fraser Health Authority and several media outlets. This is such a disgrace."

It is localized on the right side where apendix is. I am still here suffering along with others, kids, babies are included. The doctor has not even come to see me yet, they haven't even given me any painkillers. My temperature goes up and down. My wife complained and only after they moved me to a room with bed. I feel a little bit more comfortable on it but the pain persists. I can't believe every time people come and have to wait for 5-8 hours, it is not normal. You should do something about it!"

Mikayla, the PCC for all the calls, bookings, requests!
Rose - One of the nurses - EPIC CARE from this nurse.
Karen (I believe her name is) - One of the nurses - EPIC support and met needs of the family.
Alex - Epic support - Met the needs!
And all the others I didn't get the names of :(
***** Keep up the good work *****

Thanks for taking care of our grandma.
