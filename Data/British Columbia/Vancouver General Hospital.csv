The ones that were taking care of my wife seemed younger like in their 20s/30s. Just an observation and doesn't imply anything. I thank Jesus that my wife was in a private room. The rooms are assigned by availability and the condition of the patient so it's on a case by case basis as I saw some patients were placed in the hallway. The ones that were in the hallway, though, seemed to be in better health than the ones in private and semi-private rooms. There are rooms were my wife was located with around 5 or more patients. These rooms with more patients didn't have sound proofed dividers but were separated by curtains. I think this is not so much the fault of the hospital as the government. We really should have a law to be enacted to place personal responsibility of those in charge in government offices for their decisions. I pray for wisdom in the leadership in the hospitals and in our government, Father, in Jesus' Name. Bless them and I pray for Your Righteousness and Justice in every area. Amen."

I am writing to formally complain about the conditions and treatment I experienced during my recent stay at Vancouver General Hospital. I was admitted for surgery on May 17,2024, and my subsequent experience has left me deeply concerned about the quality of care and overall patient management at your facility.

After my surgery, the last night I was moved to a hallway due to the apparent lack of available rooms. The hallways were overcrowded with beds and other sick patients, creating an environment that felt chaotic and stressful. This is far from the standard of care I expected from such a reputable institution.

While in the hallway, I did not have proper access to nurses or necessary medical support. This lack of access compromised my post-operative recovery and made me feel neglected and vulnerable during a critical time. The absence of privacy and the constant noise added to my discomfort and anxiety.

I understand that hospitals can face high demand and capacity issues, but the conditions I experienced were unacceptable and not conducive to recovery. Patients deserve a safe, quiet, and hygienic environment to heal, and the hallway situation fell drastically short of this standard.

I would like to request a detailed explanation of why this situation occurred and what measures are being taken to prevent similar experiences for other patients in the future. Additionally, I would appreciate information on how to proceed with filing a formal complaint and seeking compensation for the inadequate care I received."

I asked for almagel to the nurse and she said we don‚Äôt have that here! My husband asked her what‚Äôs almagel ‚Äú she replied my husband ‚Äú it‚Äôs a numbing gel ‚Äú the nurse has no idea what‚Äôs almagel ! instead of asking me what‚Äôs almagel or maybe look at her google search. it‚Äôs so sad that nurses act as if they knew everything ! when i say it‚Äôs an antacid . I couldn‚Äôt open my eyes due to dizziness. I even asked the surgeon to order a serc or betahistine as i have vertigo and seem to trigger after surgery. i had twice of C-section and nasal polyps removal. So i know my body needs but the surgeon lied he did not order my request! That night after my husband and son left , i started experiencing some tingling, numbing sensation in my upper and lower extremities and chest pain. I reported it to the nurse and she kept telling me my vitals are normal. I managed to text my family that if i will have a stroke tell the doctor to let me go as i want to live with a purpose ‚Äú my daughter sent me text to call again the nurse which i did she took a set of my vitals and again she said your vitas is fine. but i said ‚Äúasked the doctor to checked my troponin (to check the condition of my heart)  due to heavy chest pain. she run and the lab.tech took my blood test. The nurse came back and say my calcium level went critical she gave me a crushed calcium and IV. I told her she could‚Äôve found me dead in bed if i did not advocate for myself! she asked me if i am a nurse and i said i said  YES i am a good one! because i am ! I listen to my patients and i have a good critical thinking and an excellent bed side manner! I was there for 4 days and i gave a good wisdom to all the nurses! But it‚Äôs unsafe and unprofessional practice because i‚Äôve noticed there are no charting about the incident happened that night! I have read all the chatting from VGH ENT floor from my stay Feb.9, 10, 11,&12,2024! I still remember all the names of the nurses for my stay there and the nurse who worked that night! So scary üò±.

Several doctors at this hospital prioritize expedited death over quality of life, urging patients who wish to live to forego treatment. They withhold care that could improve comfort and prolong life.

Multiple departments exhibit unprofessionalism. A particular incident involved an ultrasound technician who prioritized death over life. When determining dehydration, she refused to drain fluids from the lungs for comfort, citing potential refilling as her reason.

Her exact words were disturbing. I warn others: avoid this hospital at all costs. The care is brutal and neglectful. If you enter, you will likely exit sicker.

A disturbing example: after caregivers assisted my family member with toileting, they left feces on the commode and floor, demonstrating appalling hygiene standards.

Furthermore, it seems that Asian patients receive preferential treatment. On my floor, they are consistently assigned private rooms, without apparent medical justification. Meanwhile, Caucasian patients are placed in shared rooms. This disparity raises concerns about potential bias and undue influence, possibly related to donation expectations."

Additionally, only 1-2% of the general population in my country has such a disease, making the diagnosis even more unlikely.

I found the situation completely nonsensical and outrageous. Having been in BC, Canada for less than a few years, they didn't even have enough medical history on me to make such a drastic diagnosis. Instead of receiving anti-nausea medication and treatment for my severe migraine, I was forced to stay in the psychiatric ward with genuinely mentally ill patients for weeks.

I was so weary from the whole experience that I didn't even bother trying to get it back, I just wanted to go home... I was there for two days and there were only two nurses who were nice to me. This happened years ago, but it took me this long to write this review due to how traumatic and unhappy the memories were. But based on the other negative reviews I'm seeing here, it doesn't seem like the people working there have changed much. I'm never going to this hospital again unless I'm dying."

At last I was able to get to my room, they insist I travel everywhere on a stretcher despite my fine motor functions. But It's fine I enjoyed the rides, what a service :)
The room is pretty basic, you have a bed, small table, chair, closet and a night stand. Some of the styling of the furniture doesn't flow that well. For example they have this really high-tech motorized bed that allows you to rest flat or in upright position! The bed looks like came from a spaceship. But the night stand next to the bed looks like stayed here from 80's, just doesn't match the styling of the bed. If they want to impress their guests with they could use some help from an interior designer. For me the furniture is satisfactory.
The bathroom is shared between 4 other guesses, and the single shower room seems to be shared between the whole floor (20-30 people?). I never found shower to be a problem. The towels, shampoo-body wash-soap is provided.
The TV in the room is really old and small, I would advice to bring your own laptop. The wi-fi is pretty slow though, might wanna use your own cellphone data. Also advise to bring headphones, as you could have upto 4-5 people in staying in same room with nothing but a curtain between you.
There is no microwave, and the refrigerator is only available only through a nurse. But the food here is pretty good and they bring the food right into you room. At anytime you can also ask for a sandwich and juice and someone will bring you more food!
At this place they really care about your health so they will wake you up to measure your vital signs at 6am. So I recommend going to sleep around 10pm if possible.
The staff here is really nice and very helpful."

Despite being in critical condition with erratic heart rates ranging from 45 to 178 beats per minute, I endured a distressing 5.5-hour wait before being seen.

My experience with the staff was deeply disheartening; one attendant exhibited unprofessional behavior, openly mocking my condition and showing a complete disregard for my discomfort. The emergency physician dismissed my symptoms, suggesting I was feigning them, and seemed perturbed that I was referred by my surgeon to a neurologist rather than his own care. This dismissal occurred despite my attempts to explain the severity of my symptoms.

Furthermore, when I was in obvious pain and distress, the response from the nursing staff was not only uncompassionate but confrontational, leaving me to endure the cold and discomfort unaided while I had lots of dressing in my belly, It was only through kindness of a cleaner that I was able to find some relief.

The lack of empathy and medical oversight I experienced at VGH was shocking. My concerns were not taken seriously, and I was sent home without proper care, leading to an unnecessary prolongation of my suffering.

My family stayed here for 2-3 months before being transferred to a post-stroke rehab facility.

While some of the nurses and doctors did their best and patiently explained to me in detail of all his medications , rehab, and lab tests; I am wary of some of the revolving odd nurses who would give my family sleeping pills without much consultation from above if the dosage affects his other medications.

These particular nurses, when I came to visit, had reported that my family wasn't in their ""right mind"" at night and apparently not sleeping well/ walking out of bed/""punching"" the nurse. The nurses who declared they were ""punched"" didn't seemed to care about my father in the first place (not making eye contact with me and not fully attentive while in conversations regarding the issue, drinking their bubble tea, throwing his diaper on the bed and telling him to change it himself when he couldn't even move much). Unfortunately, I wish there was a camera just to see if they're actually speaking the truth - or if they can't be bothered so they give all the patients sleeping pills - since I don't see how he can punch being that weak.

I didn't hear any night time issues at the stroke rehab facility.

There were a few great nurses , unfortunately the hospital always changes new faces on the daily and you can't recommend keeping them.

A few weeks later, my family's feeding tube fell off, he was sent back home after waiting for 5-6  hours in emergency, and was given an appointment for the next day. We couldn't really feed him for a day. St. Paul's was quite surprised to hear this, and said to go to them instead.

Also, I'm not sure why security / hospital personnel are afraid to ask the police driver to move their empty temporarily-parked car a little forward, especially when they were parked in a spot beside a height limit pole which makes the width of the road even tighter, while I saw all the emergency & handyDart vehicles try to squeeze past the police car.

His back was operated on after a 24 hour wait but it‚Äôs currently day 4 and he‚Äôs still waiting for the surgery on his clavicles which need screws and rods. Apart from an initial visit by a surgeon the day he was admitted, no doctor has bothered to speak to him again. He has been told he can‚Äôt eat or drink in case he has to undergo the shoulder surgery. His mouth has developed sores and he is very dehydrated and distressed that no one will give him answers to his questions. I get that hospitals are stretched but it is cruel and unconscionable that he is being forced to wait so long before he gets the surgery. The term ‚Äúdo no harm‚Äù is certainly not being demonstrated at this hospital because the longer he has to wait, his clavicles will begin to heal unaligned. Keeping a patient waiting in excruciating pain with the bare minimum of pain meds is appalling as is not providing him the medical information he needs to understand what is going on. No one should be put in this position and something should be done about it immediately. It is completely unacceptable and if I could have chosen zero stars, I would have. üò°üò°"

I had to wait two hours in emergency at Vancouver General. It was quite overwhelming; so many people in pain. The nurse was professional when they checked me in. However, the nurse taking my info later was robotic. I was taken up to the OR and the anesthesiologist was not nice and the nurse seemed new and confused.

Post care was confusing to my nurse. She kept asking another nurse what to do. They wanted me to leave as soon as I could walk and I wanted to take a cab and get back to the hotel. My doctor kept reminding them that I had not eaten or drank for 13 hours. But when I asked for ginger ale the nurse said they did not have any.

He Told me repeatedly it was probably truama induced even though every possible scenario to create the issue was not something I'd experienced nor did I have any corresponding pain from a laceration or blunt truama. He left to "" figure this out"" and came back to tell me he asked a gyno but they don't deal with breast issues and then just didn't to do any imaging test because he was "" sure its nothing and probably truama"" and refered me to a women clinic telling me "" this is an issue a clinic like this would deal with and they will refere you to a place to do immaging, but they likely won't call as it's not an issue.""

An ECG was provided relatively quickly, but then the 5+ hours wait began for a blood test. After waiting two hours and watching 4 people that came after my friend recieved blood tests, my friend asked a nurse how long the wait would be for his. They replied ""soon.""

Then he waited another hour, and a doctor saw him. The doctor expected to review the blood test, and because it wasn't ready did not run any assessments. The worker clearly made a mistake and skipped my friend. Of course no one apologizes or provides any support for when he'll get his blood test.

My friend is waiting still for a blood test now - it's been an hour since he spoke to the doctor. The staff do not appear to be busy and are instead just moving slowly.

2:02am now. There's no one to help or support us or answer any questions. We walked out, with no support.

Update: once we left, the nurse called us 10 mins asking if we were waiting to be seen and that we have not been assessed yet -- clearly a call to cover their own a**. Just awful.

I appreciate our healthcare workers but honestly, this would not be acceptable in the private sector. Show some empathy when it's not an emergency. Patient care and experience needs to be prioritised.

The thoracic surgeon, Dr. Alexander Lee, was the star of the show but the supporting cast of nurses, other doctors and everyone else that I met were nothing short of amazing.

My mother passed away here and after much pestering the surgeon admitted that my mother's space would be better to serve someone who will survive. This was 3 years ago.

Last month my sister-in-law's 107 year old grandmother died in agonizing pain in the hospital because the nurses would not listen. This was a vibrant energetic elderly who had a fractured hip. That's why she was in the hospital. The nurses turned her onto the broken side to prevent bed sores. We asked every nurse in vain to turn her off the fractured side and no one listened. The doctor was even surprised that she was turned onto her fractured side when he came by later. She even tried to turn herself back but failed. She was on her broken side for over 12 hours when this was all discovered. She died from a heart attack from the extreme pain!  She died in extreme pain!  Bed sores would have been better than this!

If we had the wherewithal we'd sue!

This 107 year old was vibrant until she went into the hospital. She was living on her own and still gardening!

The family felt the staff viewed her as a waste of resource and space. That's why asking them to fix her position was ignored. Had the doctor been there he would have demanded this.

If you care about how your elderly loved one is treated squawk loud and clear so they don't die too soon."

Wait times are to be expected so I won't complain, and I always keep in mind that nurses and doctors work incredibly long hours.

My visit earlier this year was for a broken neck. I didn't appreciate the random cocktail of pain relievers my nurse gave me while waiting. The doctor that saw me was still in her residency and kind of gave me a ""you're still young"" vibe, because when the X-Ray revealed a broken neck her advice was to put ice on it, don't lift heavy, don't work out, take pain relievers, and I'll be fine in four to six weeks‚Äîno neck brace required.

Understand that nurses cannot give you an accurate wait time, as it can change from 30 minutes to 6 hours in a split second. Also, be grateful you have to wait, since the ones that get rushed in are usually VERY ill. Everyone thinks they're the worst off, but nurses are educated enough to make a decision as to whether you can or cannot wait.

That being said, I have been to this hospital numerous times. Once for very bad period pain. Did I have to wait? Yes. Was I angry about it? No. I know that my pain isn't life threatening, just like many of the injuries some of you have described on here (ex. eye pain, period pain, drunken accidents that you KNOW are not life threatening, needing a prescription). On the other hand, I have also been here on two separate occasions when I was concerned about something potentially life threatening:

Visit 1: Chest pain. I was admitted immediately, and seen by a doctor within minutes. An ECG, blood work, and chest X-ray were all done within an hour. Thankfully it was nothing serious and over a year later, I am completely fine.

Visit 2: Extreme abdominal pain in my lower right quadrant. My concern was appendicitis. I was admitted right away, and again seen by a doctor within minutes. I was scheduled for an ultrasound and the doctor explained that it shouldn't be too long of a wait, but it being an emergency room, you truly can never know for sure. It was 2 in the morning, and they had just received multiple traumas from a car crash so they asked me if I wanted to go home and they would call me as soon as they had an appointment available. I said yes. They gave me painkillers, and I received a phone call at 6 am to come back for an ultrasound. It was done right away and I had my results within 30 minutes. It was a ruptured ovarian cyst.

If you're complaining about the service and care you receive at this hospital, I'm assuming you have never been to a hospital in a third world country, and you don't understand how blessed we are to have healthcare and facilities like this. Those of you complaining about wait times, shame on you. This is a hospital that receives some of the worst traumas in the province. They work their butts off to save lives, and you're angry because you had to wait 4 hours while they saved other peoples lives and treated life-threatening illnesses instead of writing you a prescription? Get over yourselves. You're not the only person in pain. If you want immediate service for your non-life threatening injury or illness, go to a smaller hospital.

Also, leaving a negative review or complaining to the staff that they're understaffed is ridiculous. They can't do anything about it. Complain to your premier or local MP to increase funding to these places so we can hire more people."

The cleaner was working at 7am. Obviously, Rob was lying. Also, he told me ""you can find another office, if you don't like to wait, because you can walk and talk"". Then he went for breakfast. One hour later, he came back, continued to take in newcomer patients to treatment. Still ignored me. This time, in the waiting room, everyone was brought to the treatment room except for me. I continued to wait until 10:30am. I didn't get any treatment from VGH. I felt left out in the cold. In this situation, I was the only Asian person waiting, I feel that this is DISCRIMINATION.

No supervising staff was checking up on the patients  or family who seemed  to need help and instructions and were waiting to  be  discharged .
Efficiency is missing and the area can be clear up sooner .Where is the team work ?

All the staff from the waiting room to the orthopaedic surgeons that operated on me were all friendly, professional, and in good spirits. I was operated on the same day! By the next morning hey had me in a cast and on crutches. After a few screws and a plate my heel was fixed.

This will be her fourth time and I have to say the nurses on the 4th and 9th floors have been very good to my sister.  My sis acknowledges each and every one of the nursing staff and maintenance staff by name treating no one differently. I know because I usually stay with her during her time in the hospital. The only complaint is that the doctors who are involved in my sister's care should be talking to each other after procedures.  Communication is crucial in hospitals so develop better communications skills.

I stayed overnight and in another room there was someone banging their head on the wall for about 2 hours straight. I know this because when a doctor came, I asked him what the noise was. When he told me it was a person banging their head, I asked why no one was stopping them. He said they 'tried'. If you can, avoid this hospital."

It is somewhat cumbersome navigating the hospital as there are many facilities and signs are difficult to locate; however staff are helpful and willing to help. I would recommend giving yourself extra time when visiting and be patient; call ahead for appointments and speak to staff for help. It is a busy place with many people working as hard as they can, but it is not as user friendly especially in terms of space."

From outright abuse to neglect to failed delivery of an outpatient program, to a lack of programming in the wards--from the tolerance of abusive (""unprofessional"") nurses to the overdrugging of patients--the list is long of why I think the psychiatry department needs to be shut down and radically changed. I was one of those psych patients who was polite, appreciative, and hardworking--I wanted to get better. Not until I began complaining about the abuses I saw, stepped out of the pseudoscience of ""illnesses"" that didn't have medical tests, slowly got off the zombifying drug cocktail the doctors gave me, and paid for my own therapy, did I actually get better. A last resort for psych patients; there are better alternatives for those who can pay."

So many names and I can't remember them all: unfailingly patient and kind.   Pure Gold.   My special thanks go to a UBC student nurse, the lovely Adrianna, who always had time to listen as I chatted on....she will be a great nurse.

I also can't say enough about the food....in fact there is only one word: abominable.   I realize the difficulties in catering for such a diverse and large number but how can anyone do this in the name of food?  Surveys in Britain have shown that the poor quality of hospital food contributes greatly to the time taken to heal and leave the hospital.

One suggestion:  The two-bed room I was in had a washroom with 'for patients' use only' on the door.   However this was written in English and for the last two or three days of my stay, my companion was a lovely Chinese lady who didn't speak much English and her husband even less.   He was with her all day for two days and made use of the patient washroom all the time...I am sure this was only because he did not read English.  Given the diverse make up of Vancouver's population, would it not be a good idea to also indicate this restriction in Chinese and Punjabi?

Grateful thanks to all."

In the past she's been given a shot of toradol at another hospital and that got rid of the pain, it seems to be much more helpful that other pain medications. We told them that a few hours earlier she had 500mg of naproxen, and we had informed them about this. Instead of giving her that, they told us to wait in this room and gave her 3 ibuprofen and 2 acetaminophen while we wait. After 3 hours or so we asked if we would be knowing anything soon and they gave her 2 Tylenol 3's. We waited for 4 hours in a room (until 4 am) and left in the end. It would've taken 3 minutes to administer a shot of toradol like the previous hospital had done, but instead we were told to wait and she ended up taking 8 pills which were all in the span of about 6-7 hours. Next morning she was confused, nauseated and incoherent,indicating that she might've overdosed. I think this was really poorly handled and don't intend on returning to this hospital for the same reason. Apparently St.Paul's is a better hospital, we'd go with that choice next time.
