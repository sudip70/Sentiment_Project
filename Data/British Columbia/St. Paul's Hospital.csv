I was in and out due to complications from a kidney stone procedure done at St. Paul on Saturday, and instead of improving, my pain worsened significantly. Despite this (although I‚Äôve informed my nurses several times that something was wrong but this was ignored)   the treatment I received was mostly just high doses of morphine and ketamine, without addressing the underlying issues like my infection or internal bleeding which are creating excruciating pain.
I feel dismissed when asking for basic things like blankets or water and the staff seemed more focused on socializing than patient care. While I understand hospitals are busy, I felt overlooked and neglected, especially compared to other patients (most of which here for an overdose).
Looks like this health system in Canada is a total failure especially knowing that tax payers are the ones being overlooked compared to addicts ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Worst experience ever! I lived in Togo for 15years and trust me the care i was given there outranks by far the one at St. Paul‚Äôs"

I amm here with my wife who twisted her ankle accidentally. They were short of wheelchairs. Faced a lot of difficulties to take her to register to the waiting room. During the waiting time, she could not go to restroom as no wheelchair was available.

However, the officials, nurses, and doctors were really helpful and considerate. A volunteer later helped to find a wheelchair and take my wife to the x-ray section."

When you enter the ER, its kind of like entering the scene of a movie.¬† You're hit with a blast of colors, signs, sounds, gadgets, and people.¬† It's crowded and intense.¬† Having so many sick people in one place is a powerful thing.¬† You can feel the suffering.¬† After seeing so many people in pain, I suddenly felt less sorry for myself.¬† No matter how sick you are, there's always someone else in worse shape.

I felt self-conscious about being in the hospital but you soon realize that no one cares.¬† Everyone is anxious and worried about their own health.¬† It's easy to blend in with this crowd because you're just a drop of pain in an ocean of misery.

Eventually you get called up to the Register desk where you tell a nurse your story.¬† Then you get a wristband and start to look like a genuine sick person in a hospital.¬† Congratulations!¬† Then you get your blood pressure checked by another nice nurse.¬† Then you get called to the Triage desk where you retell your story again.¬† This nurse decides how bad your condition is and thus when you get to see the doctor.¬† The Triage nurse was very nice and didn't seem at all surprised at my health problem.¬† Almost like she'd seen it a million times before.¬† I was impressed with her ability to seem very concerned about my health, yet at the same time she didn't seem ""too"" concerned about my health.¬† This balanced tone was very calming for my anxiety.¬† The Triage nurse then told me to follow a black line to the second room on the right‚Ä¶the Treatment Room.¬† It's a room with a sign that reminds everyone that it's a ""weapons free area.""¬† I registered with another nice nurse and took a seat in the hallway where it was less crowded.¬† It took me about 30 minutes to get through the entire intake process.

The waiting part actually wasn't that bad.¬† St Paul's has great public Wi-Fi and comfy chairs.¬† It was like having a front row seat at a reality TV show.¬† There was an endless stream of life or death dramas playing out in front me.¬† I wanted to take a lot of pictures but I knew that wasn't appropriate so I just took a couple and tried not to be annoying.

At 10PM¬† I got in to see the doctor. The total wait time was about four hours.¬† Dr Manji was very calm, cool, and patient.¬† Amazing bedside manner.¬† I thought hospital life might age you prematurely but this doctor seemed to be youthful and thriving in a high stress environment.¬† I wish I had a fraction of his cool.¬† Dr Manji assured me that I wasn't going to die, yet.¬† He gave me a prescription for some drugs and off I went into the night with a renewed sense of hope.¬† Determined to get better and not screw up my health ever again.¬† The famous last words of every sick person.

The architecture of the building also deserves a mention because it's rare.¬† It was built in 1894 by the Roman Catholic Church, then demolished and rebuilt in 1912.¬† The design is a unique combination of the spiritual and the scientific.¬† It feels human in a way that modern hospital architecture doesn‚Äôt.¬† It's a shame that St Paul's is going to be closed soon because it has so much character and history.¬† Perception is vital in a hospital because the mind is your most powerful medicine.¬† The attitude you have towards life will always tip the balance between life and death."

I went into emergency on Tuesday morning around 8:30 am

Within a couple hours I already had a CT scan done and shortly after that I scheduled for emergency surgery as I had an infected kidney stone.

According to the plan if all went well I was to be released that same evening after the surgery.

Well I was still in tremendous pain and really not feeling well, so they decided to keep me there.  Well that night the crew that was on SEEMED to enjoy watching people suffer.

I was screaming uncontrollably, my blogosphere shot way up and I was throwing up from the pain however they allowed me to scream in pain for almost a full hour before deciding to give me some proper relief.

It was like 2am or something like that and I am sure the entire ward could hear me and I was keeping them awake but I could not control the outburst yet it seemed they were defined to punish me for whatever reason.

It broke me... It broke my spirit and it just drained every once of energy from me.. I remained in the hospital until Saturday afternoon.

The staff is extremely nice and professional but the building and infrastructure is an embarrassment to the city and the provincial public health system.

(1) Elevators - There are 2 sets of elevators for the public. One set goes all the way down to P2 but the other set goes down to Level 1 only. However, both are controlled by the same set of call buttons. Many times, I was on 6/F wanting to go to P2, the arrival of a  non-parkade serving elevator going down would cancel out my call. Not only I would have to press the call button again but if a parkade serving elevator came around the same time, it would by pass my floor because the call was cancelled by the arrival of the other elevator. This system is an embarrassment to the province.

(2) Public WiFi - There is public WiFi available but a password is needed. However, the PW is not posted anywhere easily noticeable by visitors. Not in the waiting rooms and not even in the cafeteria."

I was checked in and into a bed in the assessment ward in under 5 minutes. I was administered an IV, given a ECG and ultra sound in the next 15 minutes following. Safe to say the nurses and doctors work their tail off and did what they could in the quickest fashion to get me to a comfortable state. After 2 bags of saline and two more doses of anti nausea and pain meds I felt night and day better. I was out of there in about 2 hours all the thanks to the tireless work of the nurses and staff who are under pressure and have to deal with individuals who for the most part don‚Äôt need to be there and are just trying to get some sort of free bee. The conversations I overheard with patients beside me was head shaking but this is the world we live in when the doors are open to anyone with an excuse to see a health professional. Thank you St Paul‚Äôs Staff for making my time there comfortable and assuring of the care I was in need of."

Im now in Mexico, i got surgery, that had a tendon remove from my forearm to be put in my shoulder as replacement of the Ac ligament."

After the registration stage, after about 15 minutes, a personable and caring doctor personally came to welcome me and escorted me into the examination room.  After explaining my general condition, he told me I want to help to control your  severe pain.  Do you agree? I said, ""Please do it, and after this sentence, I entered a stage where I saw the best and most knowledgeable people in this expensive city with no facilities.""  A nurse who was older than the rest of the medical staff was responsible for my condition.  I'm sorry that I was so bad and in pain that I can't remember the name of that angel.  He treated me like a caring grandmother who takes care of her grandchild or child.  Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of the doctor who examined me, but I am sure that this doctor and nurse are definitely the angels of salvation for the people in this hospital because their behavior is beyond that of a human . If their names are important to the hospital managers, then they should be honored, I was in the emergency room on Saturday, March 30th, in the morning, and I was there until around 4:00 PM.  Mr. Dr. Frame had colorless glasses and a tag attached to his clothes. The nurse also had short white hair.

The registration staff and triage nurse were kind, helpful, and listened carefully to my concerns. After several diagnostics, I was seen by the nurses and Dr Henderson - who explained what my symptoms meant (and did not mean) - and provided prompt treatment, so that soon after I was able to breathe freely again.

I had no choice but to rush to St. Paul Hospital's emergency department to seek medical attention. Upon arriving, I found myself navigating through a series of encounters with three different receptionists, a process that consumed more than four hours of my day.

During this lengthy wait, I couldn't help but observe the unfortunate sight of several individuals struggling with addiction, scattered around the waiting area, seeking refuge and care. The hospital staff, despite the overwhelming demand, managed to attend to only one patient per hour, leaving the rest of us in a state of prolonged anticipation.

Finally, when my turn arrived, the doctor's diagnosis was disappointingly brief. A quick glance, a few words, and I was handed a prescription for some pain relievers with the assurance that I would be fine. What struck me as odd was the doctor's use of a cell phone for the examination, adding a surreal touch to an already frustrating experience.

This entire ordeal served as a stark reminder of the dire state of St. Paul Hospital's services and the urgent need for a significant overhaul. It's disheartening to witness the struggles of both patients and medical professionals in such a vital institution, emphasizing the crucial need for change and improvement in our healthcare system."

I was examined, then two doctors could not understand what to do with me. I sat in the office alone for an hour and a half, the doctors tried to understand what was wrong with me, after that the doctor contacted a specialist, and I heard a piece of doctor‚Äôs conversation(this was not told to me directly): ‚ÄúShe can open her mouth a little bit, so she is not going to starve to death, we can just sent her home.‚Äù When I heard this, I really wanted to cry, because I experienced great discomfort and pain, and the doctor‚Äôs words were very unethical and unpleasant. I was given pain medication and a referral to ENT specialist and they sent me home. Two days later, I was able to get to the ENT (in the same clinic), he examined me, gave absolutely useless recommendations (drink advil, see a physiotherapist, but only if I have insurance, try mouthguards at the dentist, again, only if I have insurance).

Yeah that's right I'm carrying around a stool sample in my pocket.
So instead of going home, I go to the washroom in radiology and collect a new sample under much duress. I come back and try to give them the sample but they still don't have my req. I emailed it to them 5 times and finally they get it and take the sample from me. Now for the kicker...

There are some rough edges.  The registration and Triage are a bit of a gong show. 10 or 11 people were waiting in a small space and  it was difficult to know who was next.  A contract security guard took it upon herself to know who was next to register. The reason it was so crowded there was because it was very hard to hear the name called for Triage, so people had to remain very close  A 'take a number' machine and a low level PA would surely solve those problems.

I'm sorry this famous hospital is slated for demolition soon.  The 60,000 odd residents of the West End will have to go a lot further away for Emergency care."

There was a throbbing pain and I was worried.The triage nurse I spoke to convinced me that things were not that bad. The doubts stopped creeping in. I was not going to lose my finger! We waited for three hours and I could see why. There were a lot of urgent cases. In spite of that, the staff were buoyant and reassuring . When it was my time, the doctor took less than a minute to assess what needed to be done. He asked me if it was okay to cut the ring. I replied in the affirmative. An extremely cheerful  nurse removed it with a ring cutter tool in no time! It was a minor problem but I was thankful to have the ring off my finger. I am also thankful that the staff at the hospital are great listeners and empathetic to the concerns of their patients."

Most of the time, you get treatment appropriate to your attitude. There is no one makes millions, they don't get bonuses so the service provided isn't of a 5 star hotel.

Last night I have so much pain during my 6weeks pregnancy and got bleeding so bad.

I decided to check emergency hospitals near me and also checked the reviews first before I go. because I don't want to feel stressed with people assisting me.

St. Pauls Hospital is the one with very good reviews and decided to go there.

From Emergency Department Check-in / Triage Nurse / ER Doctors /Entrance Door Person / Radiology Receptions, Nurses & Dr. Roberts are very friendly and very nice people. you will feel the care and concern from them. they are such very nice people üíñ

Numerous problems with poor staff in the Emergency Department had totally soured my whole opinion of the place. I ended begrudgingly went there for a very serious issue a few years back and this began a series of positive interactions and proper care. While there are still some problems with stigmatization in the ED once I was moved to an inpatient bed I began to see a whole new tone to this place. Not only was I properly helped in regards to the infection in my heart, I was also helped with an extremely bad substance abuse issue. I was boosted quickly on meds that subsided my withdrawal and during my last 8 week stay I was helped by getting a treatment bed for when I was discharged, they kept me an extra week before treatment bed was available, they fed me, they even helped me manage and budget my money as I ended up with 2 sizable cheques during my stay which easily could have been spent improperly. St.Pauls is presently an outdated hospital however the new one being built will be state of the art. And like I said....while there are still some unlying issues I gave it 5 stars for the people that went that extra mile to make sure I was going to be taken care of."

Not all my wounds were treated and or addressed. I was happy and reasonably impressed by the quick attention one would get when seeking it although they seemed like they wanted to care and be attentive it was lost in communication as they are very busy and probably understaffed. Which led me to want to leave the hospital and be elsewhere which all in all deters and effects my overall health, and treatment to being properly healthy again. I just didnt like how the wounds that did not get included or treated was right next to the one that was addressed so you would think this would automatically include the other ones within plain sight but they just went with what was ordered in the medical treatment plan. Life is full of ups and downs and bumps and bruises or wounds and so you would think they would include and or be open to other wounds or complications but apparently not and these are not new wounds either they were there when I was admitted. I am glad they allowed me to come back after being gone for the day but then I found what I have included in the photos and it makes me want to leave again.

Kudos to Vancouver Coastal Managers for a system that works.  Yesterday I has a medical emergency and went to another hospital in another health region and waited SIX hours and had to leave still unseen by a doctor.  When I went to St Paul's I was in and out in less than an hour today!!!!   From the triage, phlebotomists, ER docs and RN's everyone was professional, knowledgeable, pleasant, attentive and timely!!!!!!   I have lived in 3 provinces and this by far is the best run ER I have ever experienced.  Keep up the awesome work."

They treat you like a person versus a number like many other hospitals out there, taking the time to understand your issues by listening first.

It is an older location made up of multiple old buildings that have been attached together over the years so it can be a bit of a walk or multiple elevators to get to where you need to go"

A week and half later, I had to go to the emergency.  I was unable to urinate.  I was in so much pain, point til I was crying in agony.  I got there at 2:35 pm.  There was another lady who was there at the same time for Sciatic Nerve Pain.

I got fast tracked to see the Dr.   It was probably 30 min wait.  Dr came and took me in.  Reviewed my chart and said a nurse will come by to see how full my bladder was and put in a catheter.  I request a Catheter right away,

No nurse came by.  Maybe 30 min later a Student Dr came by.  I was in tears.  So much pain.  I explained to him, my surgery etc.  He will have to talk to the main Dr.  I told him I need a catheter, I'm worried about my Sling in my bladder.

I hear the lady with the Sciatic pain being treated.  She got a pain injection.  The lady wasn't in pain, she just wanted an injection for pain cause she's going away on a business trip!

I'm here crying in pain and still no nurse to relieve me.

A nurse finally came to check on my bladder.  My bladder had 800 mm.  The nurse put in a Catheter at 4:15.  My pain deminished right away.

I was released shortly after.

I was disappointed at the emergency.  Yes, they were busy!  Lots of people waiting.  They could have done a better job regarding pain management of clients.  Allow people in pain or severity to go 1st.

I am still in pain due to what I had put my system through.  I believe the Dr should have put a Catheter in right away vs waiting so long as per my request and pain."

I removed a star because during the night time, maybe because of lack of staffs, they ditched me for almost 6h not telling me anything.
