During that time, I could do nothing but sit in the waiting room holding my baby. Vancouver's healthcare system is truly frustrating. An emergency room should prioritize seeing sick children quickly, but that wasn‚Äôt the case here. There were numerous nurses, but they were busy chatting and laughing instead of taking care of the sick kids. When I asked how much longer we had to wait, they said they couldn‚Äôt guarantee anything but told me to expect another 4 hours. Frustrated and upset, I decided to leave. This was a very disappointing experience!!!"

It was initially established for crippled children by B.C. Women‚Äôs Institute in 1923 almost 100 years ago and in 1928, the first patient was admitted! Since then with over 800 millions invested, it has been developing, renovating, and expanding and now become one of the famously specialized children hospitals in Canada! The facility was built with sustainable design features include orientation toward solar exposure, maximization of natural ventilation and natural daylight, concourse ventilation, insulated north walls, reduction in electrical power consumption through daylighting, task lighting, and light and occupancy sensors. Walking into and through this hospital, you don‚Äôt feel it is a hospital! Instead it is more liked a colourful children play zone! Fabulously amazing experience! The physicians, nurses, technicians, staff, and volunteers.. everyone is so nice and friendly! As a parent, we are so grateful and thankful to have such wonderful children medical facility!"

My 2nd son was also born here by emergency csection at 34 weeks.. it was scary but all the staff were there to make me comfortable and make sure everything was going to be okay. My baby stayed at NICU for 10 days because his lungs werent fully developed at birth and was transferred at St. Pauls afterwards. His stay at NICU was one of the most scariest experience Ive had because I didnt know what could happen but the nurses and doctors were always to check on him and make sure he was gonna make out through the doors. The housekeeping staff are all always going around the rooms to make sure everything's clean and youre comfortable and always has smiles on their faces and congratulating me.

We go to the ER once in a while when my babies get sick and they never fail to take care of them! It's always a long wait but it's always worth it because we get the care and attention we need for our sick babies.

There‚Äôs apparently a new variant causing rashes all over his hands, feet, and body, which doctors initially misdiagnosed as hand, foot, and mouth disease.

Dr. Faizal Haji, the pediatric neurosurgeon, performed brain surgery on my nephew without obtaining proper consent from our family. After the surgery, we were informed that it was unsuccessful and that my nephew‚Äôs brain was not functioning, but we were not given any clear explanations or access to his reports and medications.

I feel that there was a lack of communication and transparency regarding the treatment provided. It‚Äôs crucial for families to be informed and involved in the decisions regarding their loved ones' care. I am left with many unanswered questions about the necessity of the surgery and the medications given. Don't trust Dr.Faizal Haji totally irresponsible and unexperienced doctor he is because of his mistake we lost our son

I urge others to thoroughly research and seek second opinions before proceeding with treatments, especially in critical situations. Trust is essential in healthcare, and my experience has left me feeling deeply disappointed.

I hope that my review helps others to be more cautious and informed when it comes to their children's medical care."

We are from a rural area and our hospital had no expertise on the matter so they sent us to BC childrens. My son and husband took an ambulance from our little hospital down and I drove behind them with our infant. We arrived around 8pm and there was tons of parking at that point and we were brought straight into a room in emergency. The nurses that we dealt with in ER were AMAZING and so kind especially with my poor husband who was just heart broken over our poor son. We became inpatient at 10:30 after the on call plastic surgeon said that he would be okay to wait until morning for surgery. They cleaned his wounds and he was so unhappy about it but ultimately got through. Our nurses in our room (Brooke& Megan if I remember correctly) were wonderful people. Checked on him lots to insure he was still doing good and his IV was placed not very well so they put it into a new area to make sure it would work great. Come the morning we went into surgery at 8am and we met basically his entire surgical team, nurses, doctor, anesthesiologist and also the two people that were right beside the doctor the whole time. Everyone explained exactly what they were going to be doing and really calmed our nerves as parents down. He was in surgery for a few hours but came out great. His recovery nurses were also so sweet, gave him some popsicles after he woke up and he loved that so much. We were out of hospital later that day and he has been healing great over the last couple of weeks, basically back to his normal toddler self. We had 2 check-ups in the hospital following the appointment and wow parking is difficult to find during the day, if you can make sure you get there early or park away and walk over I highly suggest doing that to avoid not finding a spot! Other then parking during the day, my family had an amazing experience with Childrens Hospital."

The screams got louder and my baby was now pulling his knees up but I still didn‚Äôt know what was wrong? I finally decided to go sit for 5-9 hours at Children‚Äôs hospital to see what they would say. It took only one look at my baby by a doctor there to tell us that he needed a circumcision ASAP! His urethra was blocked and his little pee hole was too small so his pee was getting stuck!! Within 15 min, my baby had his operation! I will forever be grateful to Dr Pollock who is to this day still performing circumcisions. Amazing nurses and team! Thank you to everyone at Children‚Äôs Hospital. You are all walking angels!"

Unfortunately, our visit turned into a frustrating and unsuccessful ordeal.

Upon arrival at 8:45 pm, I promptly informed the nurse about my son's symptoms. Despite his evident distress, we had to endure a 4-hour wait in the crowded waiting room without receiving a proper medical attention. My son, who was coughing with fever, desperately needed assistance. No Advil was offered to help him with his fever.

An hour after we wait, a nurse did offer a liquid to help with dehydration, but no measures were taken to address his fever or cough after that time. Strangely, a teenage girl and her mother arrived an hour after us, yet they were promptly called into a room while my son continued to cough and suffer.

When I requested an empty room for my son to rest due to his worsening condition, I was told it couldn't be provided. Even though there was an unoccupied room with a bed, my son was denied the chance to lie down. The explanation that each nurse was assigned to a room, and since there was none available, seemed both surprising and unreasonable.

The wait time was excessively long, but we had no complaints if we would have been dealt with fairness. I observed that others who arrived much later were attended to sooner. The discrepancy between the written 8-hour wait time on the board and the observed 2-3 hours for others was unsettling. The nurses mentioned they would decide who be attended first based on patient conditions but I doubt that was the case this night.

The overall experience was disheartening and left me questioning the hospital's management and priorities. I hope this feedback reaches the appropriate channels for a thorough review, ensuring that others do not face similar challenges in the future."

Waits for all patients were around 9 hours. Most parents left after 6 hours after getting frustrated, and that was the only mechanism that advanced patients up the line. When the parents leave after waiting for 6 hours+, they would recite ""make sure to go see a doctor if things get worse"", further frustrating them.

To all the housekeeping and support staff,

We may have not remember all the people who've helped us on a very stressful situation that we had but we are very greatful to you for all your care.

To everyone who is losing their patience over the wait time on any health care facility, please understand that the whole health care system around the world is suffering from man power shortage and the people who are in the system are trying their best to help everyone.

If you have had a bad experience with anyone, please give them the benefit of a doubt. They're not robots, like everybody else they can't be at %100 all the time.

Again we thank everyone who have helped us. Please do not forget to take care of yourselves while giving care for us.

Thank you."

The surgeon Dr. Skarsgard was fantastic and the night nurse Ksusha was wonderful.
However, the ER nurse called my son a ""crack baby"" because he was very active and trying to escape from us often. I thought that was so inappropriate.
The ER nurses that put an IV in were very abrupt with me and basically ignored my feelings.
Finally, the thing that infuriated me the most was that I was not given time to pump my milk every 3 hours like the nurses said I would. When I finally got a pump, it had the wrong size flanges and the hospital didn't have any other sizes! Do people not realize women come in all different shapes and sizes?
So now my milk supply is dwindled to almost nothing and my son is hungry often. I've had to resort to formula feeding and pumping 8 times a day to get my supply back up. An extra stressor a mother shouldn't have to deal with when coming back from a Children's hospital.
Please be more inclusive to breastfeeding and get some other size flanges!"

It was amazing! It's walk in only and no booking , but when I was there ( Wed morning) it was no wait at all. We got to have the draw immediately. It was my toddler's first time having blood taken from his arm but there were 2 staff, one drawing the blood and one holding him, both were very supportive and super nice to my toddler. At the end there was no crying at all! Not a drop of tear was shed during the blood draw and he even got a little froggy toy.
And when we were getting dressed back up and having some juice in the waiting room, the fun cart came by and my toddler got a colouring sheet and crayons too.
I drove all the way from Maple ridge to here for the blood work because my doctor recommended ( they are better with kids) and it was totally worth it. It's especially important that no bad memories were created around lab work so he won't be scared in the future ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíù

But today, I was really disappointed when my daughter fell face down on her chin  and land on her neck after a one and half front tuck .The coach immediately told me to take my daughter to the children's hospital. Because the position of the fall was very bad. We arrived at Children's Hospital at 6:30 and my sister could walk but felt pain from her upper back to her neck to her head.a littabout her condition and then we sat down and waited. The boys who came in at the same time or even three hours ago and fell without trauma were all assigned to rooms. My daughter was still sitting there, the only child who hadn't moved in the entire three and a half hours of the evening. She had neck pain and upper back pain, so I told the nurse, who gave her a collar. Then the wait continued. I went back to say my daughter had neck pain , Sitting for more than three hours made her more sore. Everyone went in but my daughter was still sitting there. The nurse said this is an emergency room and everyone comes in in a hurry. I totally agree, I have brought my kids or myself to the ER not only once or twice and I understand that the triage nurse will arrange for the patient to be treated according to their condition. But with a neck and back injury, there was room to arrange to lie flat, but nothing at all was done for three hours. This is completely unacceptable. After I told the nurse for the second time that my daughter's neck was hurting even more, she said if you feel pain there is a bed over there you can lie down if you want. That bed was always empty, but must the same thing be said three times before the child can lie flat? My daughter told the nurse the pain gets worse, but nurse just told her that you are fine. Even other nurse asked, she still said my daughter is fine and did nothing."

I took my baby to children‚Äôs because he was crying uncontrollably one evening. I thought it was Colic at first but he‚Äôs almost 5 months old and I assumed he was way passed that stage. He‚Äôs never ever cried like the way he did that day and obviously as a mother you worry for your little one. I took him to the hospital because I assumed that was the right thing to do. While we were waiting for a doctor he had about 2 or 3 more episodes of him crying uncontrollably like he was in pain and/or in discomfort. Doctor comes in, I can‚Äôt remember her name but she was an older Caucasian lady with glasses and very short grey hair. She was working on March.4th which was a Saturday in the evening. As she walks in, my boyfriend who is stressed and extremely worried explains to her about his cry and she interrupts him and says ‚Äúwell he is a baby and UNFORTUNATELY babies cry and there‚Äôs nothing you can do, have you fed him? Most of the time they just want to be held.. but yea unfortunately they Cry so welcome to parent hood‚Äù in the most rudest way possible, almost like she was being sarcastic.. and took the whole situation as a joke.
I was very upset on the way she spoke to us, she made us feel like we were bad parents and that being there because of his ‚Äúcry‚Äù was pointless.
I‚Äôm not sure if she woke up on the wrong side of the bed and was having a bad day or if it had to do anything with our skin colour and/or because we were young but she did not take us seriously.

Even though I‚Äôm a first time mom, we know OUR babies, we spend every day caring for them loving them and I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm doing an amazing job. And if something doesn‚Äôt feel right you bet I‚Äôm taking my little one to the hospital and I expect help and/or solutions not someone to point out the obvious!!!

I hope that this doctor is a little more compassionate and easy going with other new parents that need help because no parent wants to feel like a bad parent..!"

Dr. Firoz Miyanji is the WORST. I was a patient of his for over 10 years for scoliosis (had yearly checkups). He had pressured me to get surgery ever since my curve had gotten to about 40-50ish degrees. Told me it was too late to get a back brace and that I had no other options other than surgery despite my concerns. Always late for appointments and I usually had to wait over an hour every time and miss my classes.

12 years later and I am still alive despite not getting spinal fusion surgery.

I understand if a surgeons job is to offer surgery as an option. But if scoliosis is not life threatening, and the patient is not comfortable with this option, there is no reason to pressure a KID to do it. I wasn‚Äôt even old enough to do my own research and yet he was pressuring me to do a life changing invasive surgery. He was always condescending and rude to both my mom and I. Just because you‚Äôre a doctor doesn‚Äôt mean you can be rude and disrespectful.

He once said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on salary. I‚Äôm not waiting for your surgery to get paid‚Äù.

I had a phone appointment with him during covid, it lasted 5 min and he hung up on me.

His receptionist Valerie is also incredibly rude. When you work at a hospital where patients are already feeling vulnerable and maybe even sad, the least you can do is be kind.

Through other treatment options my scoliosis curve actually got better but he stuck to the only opinion he had and told me that it only got worse."

I went to their emergency psychiatric unit at least five or six times before i was admitted to their longer term psych unit. The white girls in the unit were sent there after one visit to the emergency psych unit. I got sent to their long term unit only after a suicide attempt that almost killed me.

The staff in the long term psych unit (P2) were nice I guess. Some nurses had a bad attitude and it felt like they thought we chose to be sick because we're mentally ill, not physically ill. I wasn't allowed to wear short sleeves in a very warm unit due to COMPLETELY HEALED self harm scars on my arms. The psych units are in the old building, they're ugly and gross and sad looking and they smell bad. No colours or anything on the walls.

I lost a lot of my teenage years to this godawful hospital. I should've received better care. I was really sick, but didn't have any way to vocalize it. After multiple visits, they should've thought something was wrong. It shouldn't have taken me nearly dying for them to finally realize that.

After 5-10min of applying pressure, we decided not to risk it and we wrapped her foot in gauze and headed straight to BC Children's ER. The room was full and I completely understand the pressures the system is under but after 30min waiting just to register and give our names, I approached the registration desk. I said: ""our baby is bleeding can we have someone, anyone just look at it and stop it."" Her response: ""let me ask the our nurses.......umm they say you will just have to wait in line"".

Let me be very clear. My wife holding our baby was not even in sight of this nurse and she didn't even ask how much blood there was; she asked nothing. This is the most insane thing I've ever experienced in Canada maybe to date. A bleeding baby gets zero response, not even a glance. Disgusting. I'll wait 10hrs in the hospital to have nurse or doctor look at me, a 43 year old man, but a 5 month old baby with a sock full of blood.......I will be filing a formal complaint and going to the media.

We went to St. Paul's Hospital and we were registered and her vitals were take within 1min of arriving. We then waited 1.5hrs for full treatment. This is how it's supposed to be.

They didn‚Äôt even examine my daughter‚Äôs abdomen carefully and the staff were not listening to me at all when I told them repeatedly my concerns about history of cancer in my family.
The doctors laughed at me when I was very worried and told them my concerns.
Guess what she was diagnosed with third stage pancreas cancer  in mid June in 2021 in Peace Arch hospital and surgery was done in VGH .
What will you say now BCH doctors? How did you miss a 10 cm diameter mass which entrapped the spleen ?!
It could be easily manageable if it was diagnosed when I expressed my concerns to the doctors and nurses in BC children hospital. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, couldn‚Äôt eat anything for one month when she was in VGH. I lost 10 lbs in 10 days. I stopped talking to everyone during that time.
On the other hand Peace Arch doctors and nurses were so quick in terms of making initial diagnosis (CA 125) and the rest of the confirmative investigations (MRI, CT and USG) coordinating with my GP and Surgeon in VGH . Within three days she was admitted for surgery. If I say Thank you it won‚Äôt be enough to express my gratitude to VGH and Peace Arch doctors and nurses.
Thank you very very much Mr. ER doctor in Peace Arch hospital (sorry I never had a chance to meet you) , Dr. P. Kim and his team (VGH) and our very much favourite Dr. Abraham / Mrs Abraham (doctor too ) and his team (Our GP).

Those of you complaining about wait times: are you serious? This is an emergency room. You're angry because your child has the flu and you had to wait a few hours while others were rushed in? Be grateful that your child can wait. Those children that are rushed in are usually in situations that require immediate care (heart and respiratory problems). Understand that staff cannot give you an accurate wait time because this is an emergency room and they never know what they're about to receive. If you want to see a doctor and want accurate wait times, go to a walk in clinic. Wait times here can go from 30 minutes to 6 hours in a split second. If you're complaining about having to wait and pay for parking in your review, I can't take you seriously. If you were genuinely concerned about your child's health, parking costs would be the last thing on your mind. Also, leaving a negative review or complaining to the staff that they're understaffed is ridiculous. They can't do anything about it. Complain to your premier or local MP to increase funding to these places so we can hire more people.

The ER can sometimes be a long wait because parents are bringing their kids in for things that are not actually emergencies.

And after that wait and questions.. if we get inside room, one nurse come check and connect the monitoring instruments and then leave us unnoticed.  Then parents have to patiently wait the doctor with completely irritated kid due to all the things hanging on them.
I asked to a nurse..  can you remove hook ups..after 2 hours of struggle..  she told me if she take out that they will take same time  again to monitor...  then what happened  to the reading they took for 2  hours??? ..

The triage nurse( Caucasian in her 40s probably) clearly  saw me in the queue but took her own time to triage another patient, after waiting for 20-30 mins she looks at me and then turns to the other nurse , discusses something and then takes her own time to call me and tell me that- It is a children's emergency and that she can't  provide ""First Aid"" to me here . I don't understand how can a hospital deny ""First aid"" to someone after making them bleed in the queue for 20mins. This is insane. People working in the medical domain are usually the ones who have higher empathy towards others and who want to serve the society. I would be highly ashamed of myself if I had to deny first aid to a person who is bleeding , she saw me waiting and she could have asked me to leave asap to another ER, if this was such a strict rule; I was standing right in front of her all the time. Luckily my Uber driver was still waiting for me , he took me to another hospital and didn't charge me anything for that trip. I saw the 2 contrasts in the society, the same day. A children's emergency is still an emergency , I rushed there because it was the closest and I was bleeding profusely.

For all people reading this who have only lived in Canada will never understand how other countries accelerate young children‚Äôs health in times of crisis. 31 days of cough, runny nose, and loss of appetite should not be brushed off the shoulders. Instead of healing, he is too weak and easily catches another bug. The doctor only suggested to do saline/hydrasense for the green snot and phlegms. In other countries, antihistamine is prescribed where it stops the runny nose-this is proactive/preventive. I wouldn‚Äôt need to extract so much snot if medicine was prescribed in the first place.

To make it short- i will file a report against her and her practice with the board of Pediatritians but i m telling you - DO NOT GO ! We went to another pediatrician who has been practicing for the last 48 years who spent 2 hrs watching our son playing and talking to him, assessing his abilities.
