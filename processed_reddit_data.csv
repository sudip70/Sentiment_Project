"41yo suboxone patient with lung cancer. I don't mean to keep pestering this sub, but I thought I'd drop in to say good-bye. The cancer is in my heart and central cardiovascular area. It's over.",66973.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ju4mua/41yo_suboxone_patient_with_lung_cancer_i_dont/,"Hello all. I hope this update doesn't break any rules, as I suppose I do not have any questions. Mods, let me know. I did not want to just disappear from reddit. I know a number of you have been thinking about me.

I said I would post an update before I passed away and, well, here I am. I know it is fast. But things have been happening fast. I don't mean to flood this sub with my misery. I'm on some heavy duty medications. I hope this doesn't come off as rambling.

This will be my final post. The Cancer is all through both sides of my chest and above my collarbone. It's over.

I was diagnosed with Extensive Stage small cell lung cancer and given four months to live on the 6th. Well, it seems ""two weeks"" was a more accurate approximation of my time. I am not long for this world. 

As for what happened-- I wasn't slated to meet my hospice team till yesterday, Friday. I went to the ER on Thursday with chest pain. They took a lot of fluid out of my chest. The ER physician described my imaging as ""grotesque"" and immediately asked if I had considered palliation. I said I didn't see hospice till tomorrow. He said if I wanted any chance of dying at home, I needed to see them NOW, otherwise he'd have to admit me. He won't be getting any awards for bedside manner any time soon, but I greatly appreciated his candor. Several urgent phone calls later I had a palliative Nurse Practitioner in my room who went through the screening process and admitted me to their home hospice program. I went home Friday morning with a hospice kit. Met the palliative physician that evening, shortly after I posted my list of questions here.

I will not see Christmas, or Thanksgiving, or even next weekend. Every breath is work. Each one more work than the last. My team estimates that, at this rate, I will die Tuesday at the absolute latest. Probably sooner. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe tonight.

My oncologist called to personally apologize for misjudging my remaining time, but I hold him no ill will. Determining the time of death is not an exact science. I know that. I'm arranging to donate my body to science. I want them to do an autopsy and see how it got me so quickly, to help other cancer patients. The oncologist thinks the cancer may have gotten to my heart or the major central blood vessels. I didn't think small cell could move THIS fast but my oncologist says we caught it late. 

My hospice team has been wonderful. I have crossed tapered from bupenorphine-- which I discontinued Wednesday-- to methadone, with little difficulty. I have a lot of morphine and the option of hydromorphone is on the table as well if needed. I am comfortable and resting at home. 

The next stop on the train is continuous sedation, and I am very tired, so I probably will not be able to respond to anyone like I did last time. My physician says we can start a midazolam drip as soon as tonight. I will probably take him up on the offer tomorrow, if I'm still alive.

I suppose this is a good place to share where my fears around palliation come from. I used to be an aid in a nursing home, many years ago. I saw a number of unpleasant deaths due to insufficient palliation. We had a wonderful man who was prescribed a self administration pump for morphine. Problem was, he was too sick to press it, and his physician did not seem to grasp the severity of his condition. Every half hour, one of us would sneak in and press the button on his pump, which, in hindsight, was probably illegal, but what else could we do? He was very uncomfortable at the end. I tried to do basic mouth care just before he passed and he recoiled in pain. ""Have a heart"", he whispered. It broke my heart to hear this admonition from such a wonderful man.

My greatest fear was Terminal Restlessness. I saw a few patients scratch their faces and tear their fingernails out as they died, even on high doses of opioids and benzodiazepines. My palliative physician has assured me that he won't let that happen and that there is no limit to what they can give me. I feel much reassured.

I have tried to write letters to the people I've wronged. I suddenly find that I want to make amends. So many letters. I was a functioning addict for a long time. My family cut me off, rightfully so. So I have been writing a lot of letters. But I am losing strength. I will not be able to write many more letters. My CNA has transcribed one letter template for everyone. I hope it is enough. 

I also had many kind offers to transcribe letters from Redditors here on the sub. What love that you would do that for a stranger. If I was strong enough to talk on the phone, I would have taken you all up on it, but I can barely talk. Perhaps, had I not been so stunned by my diagnosis, I could have arranged this sooner. But that is in the past now.

Dad, if you somehow see this post, I know how much I hurt you and and I am sorry. I wish I could call you. I do not even know where you live and I'm not strong enough to find you. I do not ask for your love, for that is beyond my power to ask. Just your forgiveness is enough. Please Dad, forgive me. I do not want die without your forgiveness. But I will, won't I?

I beseech you all to make amends with those you begrudge. Do not go to bed angry or hold hate in your heart. You will be glad that you forgave. I wish I had done so sooner, before I ran out of time. You will run out of time, too, some day in the future. Don't leave any business unfinished, any grudge unmended.

There a nicotine patch on my arm. A reminder of one of the several self destructive habits that brought me here. My smoking habit was not had enough to set things off this quickly, but it clearly did not help. For those of you who smoke, I have but one message: stop it. Please. You think you will wait till you are ready. You will never be ready. You say you will quit tomorrow, but then tomorrow becomes today, and you are never ready today, only tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes. Today is the only day in which the decision can be made. You can only quit TODAY. Do so now. Throw your cigarettes in the trash. Do it for me. What a gift it would be that my post would free you of tobacco's golden chains.

As difficult and shocking as these last few weeks have been, I regard them as positive.

Only four weeks ago, I thought that the universe was a cold and cruel place. I experienced physical and mental abuse, chronic pain, and addiction. But my situation has forced a change of perspective. I see now that all our experiences, no matter how horrid, are temporary, and that we will all find the same rest and peace in the end. 

I do not mean to give the wrong impression to those struggling with depression. I have tried to kill myself before. The difference between then and now is vast. Death is an old friend waiting to greet you at the end of a long and well lived life. It can not be appreciated properly when sought in darkness. I know there is no magic fix for depression, but I urge you to get up, go out, and live the crazy, wonderful, irrational, beautiful life you want. If only I had done the same. What a gift is life! 

Thank you all for your love, empathy, and reassurance. For all the people who PMed me offering to help with transcribing letters, for all the kind messages and comments. You are all beautiful people. I hope you remember that. No matter what anyone else says or thinks, or even what you yourself think, you are beautiful and can only be so, because you reached out to a stranger in his moment of pain. Your hearts will always carry that little light of goodness no matter how dark your days. Carry that little light with you and forget it not. It can brighten a stranger's day. It can even save the world.

A few PMed me asking to look into their religion. In the past I would have been irritated. Now I recognize that you were concerned for my souls well being. Thank you for your compassion. I am not well versed on religion, but I have prayed, and I trust that whatever higher power may dwell above the stars will look upon my situation with infinite love and compassion. This in my heart I know.

/u/hugegrape, you wanted to make me a plushie free of charge. Your care and empathy have touched my heart. I'm sorry to say that I will not be in a position to receive it. I did not expect to go this fast. I want you to make it anyway. I want you to keep it with you and know that you will always have a part of me. I hope this brings you some comfort. You have my everlasting love and gratitude.

Wishes are usually reserved for the future. I have no future. But I find myself still wishing. 

I wish I had not worried so much about the little things. I wish I had not worried so much about the numbers in my bank account or the punch of the time clock. All that time working. I had enough money to keep a roof over my head and to invest in what few hobbies I had, yet I still kept racking up overtime. And for what? Only to find myself here. It all came to nothing in the end. I robbed myself of the most precious commodity I had, time, in exchange for green pieces of paper and little metal discs. A perverse and twisted trade. Only now do I see the truth.

I wish I had had the courage to live my life the way I wanted to. I wish I had traveled the world, fallen in love, written a novel. I wish I had had children. I have no one to whom I can pass my life lessons. No one to sit by my side, here at the end of my world. It is too late for me. But it is not too late for you. Live the life YOU want, no matter how strange it may seem to others or to society. It is your life and yours alone. Live it well.

I'm not sure where I go from here. I have been reading accounts of the afterlife from various cultures. Summerland, Elysium, Tir Na Nog. I've also taken to reading The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, though it seems I will run out of time before I can finish. What a strange feeling. I personally do not believe consciousness survives death, but I'm open to being pleasantly surprised. And if not, well, who can complain about a siesta that can't be interrupted? Regardless of what awaits me, it is nice to dream.

And that is what I will do now. I will dream. I will rest and dream of the peace to come till I dream no more. May you all one day face death with this same wonderful dream.

I do not have any friends or family to sit here with me, so I am leaving this tab open. I will read your comments and savor your reassurances, even if I do not reply. I will keep you all here with me. I feel less alone this way. I will keep you all with me as I die. You people are all I have now. I am strong but I am scared. Stay with me till I'm gone. I do not want to be alone.

Till we meet again, my beautiful friends.

Robert S

Edit: just woke up from my nap and I'm overwhelmed by the outpouring of love. I'm touched by the people throwing away their cigarettes and finding the courage to pursue the life they want. What a blessing you all are. I am reading every message I can even if I don't respond. Tears streaming down my face. Now I know I will not die alone. What a gift this sub has given me.

Edit 2: Sunday at 2:30 pm. Haven been awake much but I've read as much as I can. How I cherish your love and kindness. You helped a grumpy drug addict die with love in his heart and a smile on his face. the doc will be here at 3 to give versed. I'm tired of trying to breath. chaplain has given me last rites. Its over now my friends. I love you. Good bye",,,[]

,,,,"Hi Robert. I've read all your posts. I am so sorry this is happening. Its shocking that it has gone so quickly. But at least now the darkness is leaving your soul and you are finding kindness and light in humanity. Im glad that you can let go knowing people, us here, are thinking about you and caring for you.

I want to tell you something about your Dad. He forgives you and he loves you. But your addictions were too much, too painful and he needed to find some peace. I know he loves you and forgives you. I am the mom of an addict. I KNOW how much he loves you. And he will find peace in your letter hearing how much wisdom has come to you now, at the end. 

Thats mostly what I want you to know. Also your life has had value. You have no idea of how you have affected the world.  Just because we can't see the positive things that have happened just because we exist, doesn't mean they aren't real. For example, I quit smoking 10 days ago.  Its been hard. I've felt like I won't make it. But reading your words, something loosened up in me, and I know this time I'm done with nicotine. For real, my promise to you. 

I hope you are strong enough to read these messages. I care about you and am thinking of you. I wish I could be sitting with you keeping you company. But in my mind I am.

Have a safe journey. I hope there is a kind of consciousness after death and that its a joyful free kind of thing. Im an atheist myself but even if I dont believe in a deity doesn't mean I think I have any clue of what goes on after this life. But as you say, siestas are nice too. 

Goodbye Robert. Sometimes people fleetingly cross our path but they stay in our hearts and minds. I think i'll think of you often. Sleep well friend.

Us. You can pass on your life lessons to us. We are sitting here by your side, virtually. Almost everything is done virtually now because of the pandemic so it seems fitting that you will have a bunch of internet strangers sitting virtually by your side, even if you can't see them, and that you don't know our names.

This is the first post of yours that I'm reading so I know nothing about you, only what you have written here. I'm tearing up. This is a beautiful piece of writing, and thank you for putting this gift out there for whomever finds it and reads it. 

It sounds like you are peace, and really, that is all we can ask for when we pass on into death/the afterlife/the other side/however you want to conceptualize it.

My sister died last summer of cancer in her mid-40s, shortly after midnight, with her husband by her side, at home. Their daughter had already gone to bed. My BIL is seriously the most wonderful person ever (no seriously), and my niece is the most amazing niece ever (no seriously). She went peacefully as well. Unfortunately my sister and I were not close so I didn't know the details like you've shared here. I can only imagine that her thoughts and experience would have a similar feel, longing, yearning, etc., if she had a chance to write it out. I can also imagine that it would not be something that she would have wanted to share with me, because again, we weren't close and there was not a lot of trust in our relationship. It is a privilege to be with someone when they are so close to dying, and that you are so willing to share this with us.

The internet can be, and is, and incredible thing (at times) and same with Reddit. There is tons of activity on Reddit all the time so your post will be seen by some people and missed by others and it's a totally random happenstance. I am so glad to happen to see your post today, on a day that I'm procrastinating and visiting Reddit, at a time where your post shows up in my feed.

,,,,"Thank you for sharing yourself and changing us all for the better. You've brought light and love into this world and given meaning where there was none. Thank you for your act of Grace. 

I used to believe there was nothing after death. That terrified me. I was one of the most stoic, straight-laced atheists, and as my soul mate was dying of a horrible cancer I prayed to every diety I could think of to end his suffering, knowing full well nobody was listening.

We were hundreds of miles apart and one night he was moved from hospice to intensive care, where he passed six days later. I felt him leave. I don't know how. I don't know why. I didn't know that's what it was until the next day when I got the call and realized the timing was exact. It sounds crazy as hell to tell this story. I swear on my children's lives that I felt my soul mate pass. Somehow I was with him, I felt what he felt, and the feeling was... beautiful. It was a lightness of being, a deep and profound comfort and warmth. It lasted maybe a minute and it was gone, and afterward I felt... peace. Such perfect stillness and peace.

I don't know what happens afterward but I believe I know what happens during, and there was no shame, no fear, nothing but warmth and love and Grace. I don't know how to explain it any other way.

You will receive Grace. You'll receive the Grace I truly wish life had bestowed upon you earlier.

Your dad has forgiven you, Robert. That's what parents do. He knows that your pain and struggle was about something inside yourself that you couldn't accept and though it hurt him deeply, he forgave you again and again. That's what parents do. The love is always there. It's unconditional.  

You are loved, and you are forgiven, and you will receive Grace.

I’m a college undergrad student, but ended up taking the year off because of COVID and health reasons. In this time, I’ve been reevaluating what it is I want to do in life. What makes me happy? To what do I feel passion for? What excites me and makes me want to reach further?

It’s scary to have a plan for several years, only for the tracks to be completely ripped off from beneath you. The anxiety of potential financial consequences hasn’t helped, either.

I know that, for someone like me, one of my keys to unlocking happiness is to worry less, and live more. Reading your post—with its beautiful language, deeply honest introspection, and important life lessons—made me cry. And helps me see what *really* matters in life, not what our socioeconomic constructs *tell* us matters in life.

You may not have had children to pass your life lessons on to. Nonetheless, go in peace knowing that you still passed down your lessons to a young adult, who desperately needed to hear your wisdom.

Thank you for sharing your story and your thoughts in this vulnerable time of yours. You said that you have no one to pass on your life lessons to, but that isn’t true. You’ve inspired me in so many ways after reading your post, as I’m sure many feel the same way. I will forever remember you & your message. I’m a smoker and I recently had to quit due to pregnancy. I’ve been counting down the days until I can smoke again. You’ve just inspired me to never pick that shit up again. I’ve already quit, the hard part is over. I’m tired of poisoning myself. I have mental illness to thank for not caring much about my life, but I’m going to try and find at least one good thing every day. I’ve saved your Reddit posts to look back on and remember you by. You’ll never be forgotten - at least not by me.

My girlfriend having only known me as as a somewhat reserved person who doesn’t get too worked up, is somewhat taken aback. 

Coincidentally, I was talking with my mother this morning who wants to go and spread my father’s ashes at his favorite spot before she packs up for good and moves a few states away. He was a lifelong smoker and drinker who died 5yrs ago, less than 2 weeks from being admitted to the hospital for severe leg cramps. Long story short, I was living across the country and only made it in time to see him lucid for a couple of hours before he went to sleep and died.

Maybe it was Robert’s writing or maybe it was just happenstance that my mother chose today to share her plans. Either way, this was surprisingly difficult to read even tho the positivity of the post was clearly there in everyone’s response.

They may pretend they don't, but that's usually in service of some higher goal for you.

For instance a toddler lying. The dad might not think of anything about it, but he has to deal with the issue and not everyone expresses themselves all that clearly.

I've a drunk father and we occasionally have yelling matches. He can't admit to being wrong and never really respects my life choices and interests.

Still, sometimes, just sometimes, he apologizes, in his own way.

My point being that

I believe your father would forgive you.
And if you give out some of his info, Reddit could probably track him down pretty fast.


Amazing post. I'm confused by all the dissonance within me. It's so sad, yet true, and that brings in the love and respect.



I don't want to push any religion and it might be a bit late considering your limits at the moment, but if you have any friends who do shrooms, that could be a way to visit a heavenly realm while still in this world, in case there's just a long nap afterwards. 

It's helped a lot of terminal patients deal, but you seem to be dealing even without.

I'd send some myself but northern Europe, would prolly take too long.

Hope you've either done them before or still have time for one.

Maybe not with the palliative care you're receiving. Although shrooms don't seem to mind opiates and won't really add to risk factors. A bit, of course.

Just a thought.

Huh, that spawned another thought. Maybe watch some Bill Hicks for entertainment. [Bill Hicks (end of set) ""It's just a ride.""](https://youtu.be/eNEyLn1Zz_g)

Very funny, makes good points, philosophical.



You're a good person and I'll bet my left nut that your father would forgive you. Would you like to? I'm not a medical professional but I can help get the gears running to track the family should you so choose.


And don't worry about replying.

Oh man we seriously need to get brain computer interfaces working for situations like this.


Your post, its sentiments and you, will never die in the same way that we can still read the thoughts of long since gone philosophers.

Sure, maybe there's not as much of it, but the chances of it staying around now are nonzero I would say.

So metaphysically you've already immortalized yourself by selflessly and honestly sharing your story, pains and all.

I wish you to be at peace.

,,,,"I’m never on Reddit often, I only checked it because I noticed a notification in my DMs, then I found this on the front page. I’ve read suicide notes and seen people die, but I’ve never read a message from a man on his death bed where he thanks everyone for being with him in his final hours. Thanking thousands of strangers, being open to the afterlife, trying to write letters to amend for your wrongdoings; these are such honorable things. And while this is the first post I’ve seen from you, and probably the last, I will not forget about this. Ever. People are throwing away their cigarettes just as I threw my parent’s’ away whenever they still smoked. I didn’t think I’d be tearing up the moment I looked at Reddit, but it is worth it. Whether you’re with us or not, you are worth it. You’ve accepted the inevitable and done what you can to right your wrongs while being in this situation. I’m unsure about religion as well, but reading that you- someone who has also questioned religion, is now being open to different interpretations and researching possible outcomes, I must say that this has inspired me. I will be thinking about religion in a whole new light thanks to you, and I appreciate it. May whatever divine being- if there is one- bless you in your final moments, and may you know the amount of outpouring love that you can take with you till the end. Bless your soul, Robert. I may have never known your face, never knew who you were, or never known what was happening before this post, but, after this, I’ll never forget the imprint that you’ve placed upon my heart.

I don’t even know how this post came to me. I’m not a member of r/AskDocs. But there you were, waiting for me. I opened and read your whole post. And as tears lined my cheeks I couldn’t help but recognize your energy was what came over me while I sat in contemplation in the car. I am very spiritual and do not deny for a second that you helped me tonight even before opening this app and reading your words. 

Go into the wild knowing that you’re helping millions. We here are just lucky enough to witness you head-on.

,,,,"My Eulogy for Robert S.

In the latest moments of a dead man, we feel words. He, someone unfamiliar, was truly a stranger. His act of communicating though, finds words which lay down heavy onto us, funneling deeply, through, and across the many minds it passes. Fleeting in time, strength, and clarity, Robert still gifts us with tragedy, memory, emotion, experience, and introspection. While under pressure of known despair, he connects; he connects us. 

His words written and thoughtfully given, Robert S. is no stranger. We relate to his perspective, in empathy, in sympathy, in human experience. When searching in his words, however apparent, do not find suffering. His message in its core pleads *for* us all: as a hopeless man, he hopes. Find happiness, find hope. I will remember Robert as a man out of wishes, wishing ours to be granted. Through our own power, we can grant those wishes of ours and Robert's. We can repay his gifts given. We should give power and meaning to his words and to his life lived.

Thank you and rest in peace, Robert S.

,,,,"Robert,

I don't really have religion or an intense sense of spirituality but I do certainly know when something, anything, has reached a level of profound that it shakes your existence to the core.  A brief moment in time that leaves you gasping for air as you reel in shock and try vainly to process what the hell just happened.  These moments can be beautiful or harsh but the one thing that they have in common is that they leave you forever altered.

Robert your words left me sobbing and momentarily insensate with grief; but as soon as I could breath through that stark emotional journey I was left with a sense of childlike wonder... 

I have my health!
  
I have my breath, my legs, my fingers, and my eyes!

I have everything I need to give myself the life I want.

I have been squandering my limited time in this world because of my own fear and nervousness to take that leap of faith and create/allow change.

No more! 

I promise Robert that I will not forget you and there will be endless moments for the rest of my life where I will think specifically of your intensity and timeless wisdom.  Every dream that I will touch will be filled with gratitude and will be fueled by your words.

I don't care if these thoughts of mine are lost in the masses or if they are disregarded as the overzealous ramblings of a childless achievement-less middle aged woman.

I have this experience of the profound you've given me my friend.  And I will always have that.

For the first time in my life I am happy to tell a stranger that I love you very much from the bottom of my heart!

Thank you Robert!  Thank you...

Until then, rest well friend, do whatever you feel like doing, treat yourself to whatever you still can, and then go knowing you have made use of the time that was afforded to you by the random chances we are all subjected to to the fullest and to the best of your abilities.

Robert, I don’t know if you’ll see this post as I’m commenting rather late. I don’t have some great wisdom to share, but I want to tell you and anybody else who needs to hear this:

You are so loved. 

I’ve fought addiction to alcohol and prescription pills my entire adult life (I’m 26 and started at 18). I’ve had periods of sobriety, and I‘ve had terrible relapses. I’ve definitely caused a lot of pain to a lot of people. You mustn’t forget though that for all of the pain you may have caused, you’ve also spread kindness and goodness in this world. Most people touch far more lives than they’ll ever know. What seems like the smallest gesture of kindness could change and even save a life. I hope that brings a tiny bit of peace.

Monday, Nov 16 Noon-
I put down the smokes like you asked.  I’m up to hour 28. I hate my husband and i’m cold and I keep wanting to walk to my back porch except there’s no pack and no lighter and no ashtray.  I have a tiny vape that is too small for me to break in my fist and a backup in case this one gets lost/dropped/thrown at my husbands head because he won’t do the fucking dishes.

My allergies are 50% better, and I am snide about it because there’s no way that one day without cigarettes did that.

My skin is dry and my video game is annoying, and I bet by tomorrow I’ll hate way more stuff than I do right now.

....that’s all i got, now i need to go buy moisturizer that will doubtless make me colder and might cause a divorce.

UPDATE:

Hour 51. Have not thrown vape yet.   Still cold, still want to walk out back and draw on something that isn’t there.  Reminded husband that he has literally not cleaned a toilet in 3 years and that I can’t paint because he spies on me.

No coughing yet, and that’s annoying because at least then I’d feel like i was accomplishing something.  My allergies are still better.  I’m still cold. I’m still tired.   I can’t think of anything fun to do.

My contractor asked for $60,000 by the end of the week and I don’t even care because I’m thirsty.

Smoking is like going on a ski trip where there are no lifts to get you to the top of the mountain.  The cost of doing it is that you have to drudge yourself, miserable and bored (*so fucking bored*) and uncomfortable, back to where you started. Uphill. In bad shoes.

**2nd Update Wednesday evening, Hour 80-ish.  I’ve lost count.**:

quitters flu.   there is so much snot.  i am tired. i feel less angry, but let’s not test the theory. soooooo dehydrated.

Robert.....You better be watching over me, you sunovabitch.  I can’t believe I’m doing this.

**Day After Thanksgiving**


Friday, Nov 27

I can’t believe I’m still here.
and that I think about buying a pack almost daily.  Shouldn’t I be over this already?

Pretty sure I’ve lost sight of why I quit, except for Robbie, so I better go back and read his posts again.  It’s not like I’m trying to save myself for or from anything.  I came to the realization that I wasn’t smoking because I wanted to smoke, I was smoking because I wanted to die, but it was so low key, I took the stupidest road possible.   The road that allowed me to die just a little bit.

There’s an old muslim saying, though:  “*You do not want to die.  If you think you do, go...run off a cliff and throw yourself into the sea.  You will find yourself fighting for life.  You will find yourself fighting to live*.   

*You do not want kill yourself, you want to kill something inside you.  That is different.*”

I wish robbie had understood that earlier.

Monday, December 7

Oh my god, the smells.  So many smells.
New problem...my vape was great because my juice had steeped for about 6 months, but the new stuff isn’t here yet and i think i’m at the end of my rope.

Which means Im about to be on my own.

I am hoping for an extreme flu to keep me laid up.  I hope it also destroys my sense of smell again.

There is an old belief,
That on some solemn shore,
Beyond the sphere of grief
Dear friends shall meet once more.
Beyond the sphere of Time and Sin
And Fate's control,
Serene in changeless prime
Of body and of soul.
That creed I fain would keep
That hope I'll ne'er forgo,
Eternal be the sleep,
If not to waken so.

,,,,"I don’t know that I can say what I really want to say to you. I hope you’re able to read this because I want you to know that you are in my thoughts. You have such a way with words and I hope you are comfortable. I think in the end, we will all have some regrets to some extent. But I think that’s what makes humanity morbidly beautiful in a way? We are so complex as human beings, and I hope you can take solace in the fact that you have lived your life the way you wanted to—it was just not enough time to do the rest of the things you could do. 

Your self reflection means a lot to me. I struggle with my mental health in the long term, and as it stands, I resigned from my stable job because it was taking its toll on me physically now. Much like you, I am at an em passé and I am scared too. I let things get to me and I wish they didn’t. I would like to think that it’s because of mental illness that I can’t function like everybody else. Sometimes I feel like it’s not fair that I feel so much pain in my life so often, and still have room left to feel the pain of others. What kind of cruel fate is that? At times I wanted to indulge in some unsavory things that would have led me to more self destruction, just to escape from my emotions, my thoughts, and my responsibilities. A lot of times I say I’m too weak to live. But then I read what you’ve had to say in these posts, and it makes me think that maybe I shouldnt be afraid. 

Maybe I should just leave my current career for good and see what else is out there. I am so miserable with this, and there is no way I can keep trying to make it work anymore. It seems the consensus is that “this is what it is and always will be” with my line of work, and that is so disturbing to me. 

I don’t want to live with so many regrets. If anything, I would hope that my only regrets in the end would be things like: not hugging my partner more tightly, having done too many things in life to remember or recount, having too many people who love me around and not enough time to spend one more meaningful moment with each of them, etc. 

I really wish you the best and thank you so much for sharing with us. I hope you know that you have helped me today. 

I don’t know if this helps you to know, but I know there are programs out there for those who don’t want to be alone in their last moments.

I lost my dad three weeks ago to COVID. My eleven and half year relationship ended; it was my fault. I’ve realised that the career I’ve worked so hard in and changed my life for over the past 12 years doesn’t make a jot of difference to anyone. I’ve realised that people can be very selfish and I’m naïve for thinking otherwise.
I’m 44 and missed my chance to have children. I could feel sorry for myself but reading your post pulled me out of the pit of self despair I was willingly sliding face-first into. 

Thanks for sparing your thoughts in a time when you were probably flooded with emotion and pain. Thanks for trying to help others though you might not have received that help yourself.

Your legacy of wisdom is here on this page and that will never go away — as more people share your words the admiration and understanding will grow exponentially. You’re going to live forever and keep making a difference to many. Who can say that?

Thank you for telling your story, Robert. Your words have touched the hearts of many, and you have inspired change in us. You made us see the impermanence of life. You inspired those struggling with nicotine addiction to throw out their cigarettes today. You inspired me, a person suffering suicidal ideations to live the life *I* want, that death will be there for me in the end. That death is patient, but life is not. That it's to greet me after a long and well-lived life.

I will remember you and your words and ponder them in my heart. Although I know that you may not be here with us by the time this comment is posted, if there is some sort of god or afterlife waiting for us at the end of the tunnel, then I know that this has reached you in some way.

Tears streamed down my face as I read this letter. I am so sorry you have to go through this, especially with just us strangers. You have no idea how much of a change you have just made to my life and I will forever thank you for that.

This has also motivated me to get help for my mental illness, to finally come out as gay despite the homophobic family, put right some wrongs, go to the doctor (I’ve been ignoring some issues) and live an authentic life that I want to and enjoy.

,,,,"Hi Robert. I came here from /r/popular. I haven't seen your other posts. 

But I think I'll take some time later to check them out.

If there's one unique thing I can say that hasn't been expressed by others (and I do support what has been said so far), acceptance and denial are a wave that go up and down. 

I had a friend with a terminal illness and spent a lot of time in his children's hospital just waiting around and ended up being summoned to play with bored kids. On some days, kids were okay. At other times, they weren't.

But at the very end, it all comes back to the calm. I always asked the nurses.

You may not have the wave. You might feel like the wave lasts forever, but I've learned it will pass. 

Be in the moment. It's okay to say ""I'm scared right now"" or ""I don't want this"" or to be angry, sad, etc. Say aloud to yourself that you do feel this way and it's okay. It's totally normal. 

Accept.

Then read someone else's post here. Change the tune. 

That's your crash course in behavioural therapy and radical acceptance. It's not about giving up, it's about saying ""I accept this reality"" and then move on into the present rather than the past. 

And don't dwell the hurt the old you caused. That was the old you. That person isn't one you are now. You're the one who's making amends for that guy. 

Best wishes.

,,,,"Hello, Robert.

Though I don't know you, I was very touched by what you wrote.  Thank you for taking the effort and time to share it.

I feel you are one of only a few people I could tell this to, who can relate.  I was recently diagnosed with multiple issues, that had been getting worse over time, and would have most likely cut my life short (I am around your age) in just a few years.

But I heeded the warning, and I have done what's needed to be done.  Complete lifestyle change.  And while it's only been a couple of months, the signs are looking good.

I know what it's like to get that feeling when you're told, the fear it's the end of everything.  Some choose to not heed it, some somehow find the strength to do so.  It is awful you didn't even get that choice, and my heart goes out to you.

But I know you will take some solace that some people do get given that chance, and some of them take it and do as much as they can to make it work.  That that knowledge and fear lights a fire within them and they change what needs to be changed.  Hopefully, in my case, for a long time yet.

I wish you a safe and pleasant journey to wherever you end up.  You know and value what life and time is, now.  That's the greatest lesson, and you passed that test.  Your post shows the wisdom that would have been unthinkable to you just weeks ago.  Stay relaxed, feel all your emotions, and go on until you feel you can't anymore.

,,,,"If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music
Would you hold it near as it were your own?
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
If your cup is full may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home

- Ripple by the Grateful Dead

Ive been heartbreakingly suicidal the last year. I finally decided that I was going to go through with it recently. I tried hard to fight it, though. On thursday, after a year of separation, my husband moved out. He packed his shit, and left, at the EXACT same time that I was in a meeting with my bosses for the one and only job that I passionately loved, and was laid off. Neither my husband nor the lay off were my fault, but I decided it was time.

Reading your post made me realize just how much I have been taking my time for granted. For a bit of context, I am currently a high school student who is aiming to someday become a medical doctor as it combines two things I love: Biology and helping others. Unfortunately however, my family tends to come from a lower-socio economic class which complicates getting the finances needed for university, and so getting the highest marks in pursuit of scholarships have always been THE top priority for me. My obsession with marks would often get to a comical point, where I would verbally 'fight' my teachers for the purposes of increasing my marks for about 1%. However, after reading your post I felt as if whatever I have been doing was pointless. All this time that I have spent creating discord between me and my teachers and parents could have been spent much more wisely, and now I realize what a valuable resource time is.

Sacred thresholds on our journey.
Birth and death are a game of hide-and-seek.
So laugh with me,
Hold my hand,

Say goodbye,to meet again soon.

We will meet at the source of every moment.
We meet each other in all forms of life.""

Your story has helped me. Hearing your journey that lead to tonight... your acceptance of death... it’s made me hopeful that maybe one day I can be as brave as you. I spend so much time fearing death, I’m not allowing myself to live. That’s the biggest disservice I can do to myself and it’s shameful.

,,,,"I'm sorry. My grandmother passed away the same way with small cell lung cancer. She smoked from a teen until her 50s, it killed her 20 years later. She was diagnosed on her 75th birthday and was dead 3 months later. There was no chance to treat it. 

I'm not going to say she went peacefully. I hope anyone who currently smokes reads this and changes their habits. In the last days my grandma would wake up, covered in blood she had coughed up in her sleep. Her sister would take her to get cleaned up and my grandma would be so confused saying, ""is that blood? Who's blood is that? Is everyone okay?"" She was too delirious to realize she had coughed and spat that blood out all over the front of her nightgown. 

Eventually she just couldn't breathe, fluids had built up in her chest cavity, a nurse asked her if she wanted to be resuscitated as she was suffocating. My grandma nodded yes, despite previously signing a DNR, she ""survived"", but she had a heart attack from the fluid putting pressure on her heart. A day later my family pulled the plug. I did not go to say goodbye. This last traumatic part happened the night I turned in a final paper and was planning to drive to see her the next day but she was already in a coma.

This is the first post of yours that I have read. As a few others on here have also mentioned, I usually just lurk around a handful of my favorite subreddit and favorite/upvote posts that I enjoy. But today, I decided to browse the popular posts section, for one reason or another. That's when I came upon yours.

It's been several hours since you wrote this post, but I wanted you to know that I read every word. And, there wasn't one point where I thought of backing out of this post and moving on to something else. I just wanted to write to you and tell you that your words had immense weight and impact on me. A stranger.

I'm in my 30s, so slightly younger than you are. And I've always thought that I should do something with my life. But it always seems that procrastination would rule over any hopes and dreams that I could achieve or accomplish. Not anymore. I'll always remember what you wrote, and I will try my best to be better both for myself and everyone else around me. 

I want you to know that I'm truly touched by your words. The lessons and advice you give out freely to all of us. Your soul shines brightly, and I feel lucky to have been here and be a part of this.

I hope you know that you've helped me realize that time is not infinite. Forgiveness should be given more often. And hate in one's heart is nothing but poison.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us. From one stranger to another, know that I and all of us here are with you. And we will remain with you.

Thank you.

,,,,"Unfortunately, I fear death and have always feared death. I fear death so much that a darker(?), braver(?), more cowardice(?) part of me nags at me to just get it over with, like ripping off a band-aid. Despite the regular meditation and the religous studies classes I’ve taken, or books I’ve read; the only “comfort” I can provide is that scientifically, you are made of energy and matter. Science shows that energy and matter never dissipates but merely transforms. So no matter what, the energy/matter that is you, will always be around. Your passing is not an end, it is a rebirth and an evolution. You will forever live on and have the opportunity to effect more in this universe with your dissolution, many more so, than you ever would have been able to with this ephemeral and often painful existence. 

Reading your post, I can tell there is a lot of hurt and regret residing in your heart... and I’m sorry life has led you through those paths. Life would seemingly be a grand parade, if only there was no pain and heartache... and for fucks sake I wish there was less pain and heartache in this world; but without darkness, there is no light and I can sense, that what ever might have led you astray in the past, has brought you to a place looking for forgiveness and positivity. To me, this is what matters most. This is the true execution of repenting, not because you are afraid of hell but because you truly wish to be a more positive influence in the universe. From an energy stand point, I think this means a lot. You are taking, not even the first steps but the preparation before hand, to make sure the darkness you experienced can provide a guiding light for those that come subsequently in this life and that your upcoming journey is rooted in love. Which really, is what this world needs the most of, love and empathy.

I don’t know, hopefully this helps... if not, I 100% understand. I’m not truly sure if it would’ve helped me if I was in your place. Do believe that it comes from the heart and that I wish you the best in the days to come. If there is one thing that has mildly helped me in my search to overcome the looming clutches of death. Director Kevin Smith of Clerks fame almost died of a heart attack a few year back, like me, he has expressed fear in death regularly. On the operating table he describes a feeling that took over his consciousness, he states that being close to death felt like a complete release of worry and responsibility, he says that the allure of death was a sense of complete blissful freedom a freedom that could never be experienced on this mortal coil, a freedom he would have gladly embraced if he didn’t have a wife and daughter he need to care for.

That being said, I know I’m an internet stranger and I know you have several comments to read and possibly respond to BUT if you would like and you have the strength and let’s be honest, trust. Provide me some info on yourself and your father/family and I’ll see if I can do some internet sleuthing to find him and let him know your dying wish was for forgiveness. I don’t think love will be an issue. He’s your father and no matter how slighted and hurt, there will always be love deep down inside

It doesn't make the hurt we may have caused to others—and *ourselves*—any less, but we can't undo that.

Dear Robert,

Thank you for allowing us to be with you in times like these. I am an ICU nurse and I am only beginning to get the exposure of our end of life care/palliative care patients. I will continue use your strength to keep spreading love, compassion and positivity to all those souls I come across. 

Rest peacefully.

I would like to share with you my favourite lyrics by Jewel, ‘Hands’

‘ If I could tell the world just one thing
It would be that we're all ok
And not to worry because worry is wasteful
And useless in times like these
I will not be made useless
I won't be idled with despair
I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

My hands are small, I know,
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

Poverty stole your golden shoes
But it didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But i knew it wasn't ever after
We will fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

My hands are small, I know,
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

In the end only kindness matters
In the end only kindness matters’",2.0,"['dear', 'robert', 'thank', 'you', 'for', 'allowing', 'u', 'to', 'be', 'with', 'you', 'in', 'time', 'like', 'these', 'i', 'am', 'an', 'icu', 'nurse', 'and', 'i', 'am', 'only', 'beginning', 'to', 'get', 'the', 'exposure', 'of', 'our', 'end', 'of', 'life', 'care', 'patient', 'i', 'will', 'continue', 'use', 'your', 'strength', 'to', 'keep', 'spreading', 'love', 'compassion', 'and', 'positivity', 'to', 'all', 'those', 'soul', 'i', 'come', 'across', 'rest', 'peacefully', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'share', 'with', 'you', 'my', 'favourite', 'lyric', 'by', 'jewel', 'hand', 'if', 'i', 'could', 'tell', 'the', 'world', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'that', 'we', 'all', 'ok', 'and', 'not', 'to', 'worry', 'because', 'worry', 'is', 'wasteful', 'and', 'useless', 'in', 'time', 'like', 'these', 'i', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'useless', 'i', 'wo', 'be', 'idled', 'with', 'despair', 'i', 'will', 'gather', 'myself', 'around', 'my', 'faith', 'for', 'light', 'doe', 'the', 'darkness', 'most', 'fear', 'my', 'hand', 'are', 'small', 'i', 'know', 'but', 'they', 'not', 'yours', 'they', 'are', 'my', 'own', 'but', 'they', 'not', 'yours', 'they', 'are', 'my', 'own', 'and', 'i', 'am', 'never', 'broken', 'poverty', 'stole', 'your', 'golden', 'shoe', 'but', 'it', 'did', 'steal', 'your', 'laughter', 'and', 'heartache', 'came', 'to', 'visit', 'me', 'but', 'i', 'knew', 'it', 'wa', 'ever', 'after', 'we', 'will', 'fight', 'not', 'out', 'of', 'spite', 'for', 'someone', 'must', 'stand', 'up', 'for', 'what', 'right', 'cause', 'where', 'there', 'a', 'man', 'who', 'ha', 'no', 'voice', 'there', 'ours', 'shall', 'go', 'singing', 'my', 'hand', 'are', 'small', 'i', 'know', 'but', 'they', 'not', 'yours', 'they', 'are', 'my', 'own', 'but', 'they', 'not', 'yours', 'they', 'are', 'my', 'own', 'and', 'i', 'am', 'never', 'broken', 'in', 'the', 'end', 'only', 'kindness', 'matter', 'in', 'the', 'end', 'only', 'kindness', 'matter']"

Thank you for sharing your story with me and thousands of others; you have touched a lot of people's lives in a very short period of time. You may not have children to pass your wisdom down to, but I assure you, I will be revisiting this lovely letter to remind myself of the fragility and beauty of life. 

I am twenty years old. My father just dropped dead in September. I flunked out of this semester of college; it will be difficult to go back. I am feeling the pain of his absence, and the pain of (what feels like) my own failure, every day, on top of depression and a severe instance of panic disorder. I have aspirations but I'm not really sure if I'll ever get there; I'm afraid to chase my dreams and travel the world because I'm scared of not being financially stable. It's a really shitty thing in our society that pursuing our passions and humbling ourselves with other cultures, lands, and religions is considered a luxury, if not sometimes even frowned upon.

Your words have resonated with me.

I'm not a believer in religion, really. I'm not an atheist though, so I guess I could be considered agnostic. I commend you for keeping an open mind and making peace with whatever awaits all of us on the ""other side."" 

I'll be praying to whatever universal entity might be listening, in case anyone IS listening. And thank you so much for helping me to put some of my current stressors in perspective. You have reminded me to take care of my body, cherish the people I love, and leave my mind open. I feel a certain heaviness in my heart knowing that it's under your circumstances that I had to he reminded of those things. But, what a beautiful thing to make of your last days, and your last words. 

Much love to you. Please have sweet dreams.

You have taken this horrible situation and forged a beautiful example from it for all of us. Truly making lemonade :) 

Earlier this year I suffered a severe stroke at the age of 24. At the time, there was also a suicide in the family which broke us. I recovered, but fell into a deep depression that felt like a bottomless pit. I still haven't clawed my way out. Every day is a battle, and I never know what the next day will hold. If I'll be able to get up. If I'll be able to feel anything but total dread. When those days come, I will read this again to remind myself that life, as you put it, is a gift.

,,,,">There['s] a nicotine patch on my arm. A reminder of one of the several self destructive habits that brought me here. My smoking habit was not had enough to set things off this quickly, but it clearly did not help. For those of you who smoke, I have but one message: stop it. Please. **You think you will wait till you are ready. You will never be ready. You say you will quit tomorrow, but then tomorrow becomes today, and you are never ready today, only tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes. Today is the only day in which the decision can be made.** You can only quit TODAY. Do so now. Throw your cigarettes in the trash. Do it for me. What a gift it would be that my post would free you of tobacco's golden chains.


I've been talking about wanting to quit for quite a while now. I've had a few successes, 6 weeks here and a few months there. But this last time has been even more difficult to just actually get my mind set to quit.



Today marks 1 week, and 2 days. The moment I read this, it was the last cigarette I had that night. The next day was the last day I smoked.



If it weren't for the perspective that Today is the only day that a decision can be made, I might not have ever quit.


I know there were feelings of regret, and not having anyone to pass your knowledge to, but that obviously wasn't the case. You helped me.

I've never done drugs but we all have our vices, don't we? Spending too much time watching TV, too much time looking at a phone, too much time worrying about what others think.

I want you to know that you have been heard. Your message has reached us. Whenever I am feeling envious, or proud, or ashamed of myself I will remember what you shared with us. I will think, ""This is enough. I am not more nor am I less than anyone else. I love and am loved in return.""

It hurts me because I know I could watch someone I love die from cancer. I started smoking... in my mind... because if he was slowly killing himself... so would I.  Its been on and off I smoke for months now... but the past couple weeks....not been feeling right inside and I cough a lot. Its a numbing dull pain. Hard to breathe. Anyhow... I kept smoking last night even. I thought... if he loved me... he wouldn't want to watch me smoke and kill myself with him.... he would quit. At this point... reading your post... I quit anyways. Because that's not love. Love isn't killing yourself to prove a point to someone they should stop killing themselves too.

,,,,"Hey Robert 

I’ve just read through and I’m sorry to read all that you are going through and I pray that you get to read this message 🙏🏻 

John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”
‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV‬‬

There is one way to Heaven. Jesus said: ""I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father but by me."" (John 14:6) 

This one way is to accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior and follow God's plans for our life which are laid out in the Bible.
Good works cannot save you. Faith in Jesus alone can save you.
""For by grace you are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast."" (Ephesians 2:8-9)

I just want to give you some hope within this time of need that your going through. You have an amazing opportunity like no other right now, the Holy Bible says ‘all’ who believes in the son of God Jesus Christ will have ‘eternal life’ a hope like no other that this isn’t our final destination and we will receive a new resurrected body with no decease, no more pain, no more suffering, no more fear or tears Jesus says “behold I stand at the door and knock whoever opens I will come in and dine with you” 

All you have to do is say forgive me my sins I believe that you came to set me free 

If your thinking I’m not worthy?! Even on the cross of Calvert in the last hour of one of the other men on their cross he forgave him and said “you will be with me in paradise” a sinner up until he asked for forgiveness before he was going to die wow how incredible to know that we are loved that much by God our Heavenly Father 💚🙏🏻 

Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be your name 
, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespassed  against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever and ever 

Lord Jesus Christ I believe that you are the son of God, forgive me of my sins and release your amazing Grace and Mercey upon me so that I may share eternal life with you Amen 

May the Lord bless you Robert and keep you and turn his face towards you and grant you his peace in Jesus name I pray Amen 🙏🏻

I’m still relatively young. At only 21 I’ve experienced death only a couple of times. Freshman year of college, my grandfather whom I live with was told he had four months to live, but he passed that weekend. I was devastated that I missed it, and that I did not have a chance to speak to him.

Now I know we don’t know each other, but your story is really touching, and I really wanted to let you know that while I still have the chance. I hope you know you touched so many people here, and while we can’t be with you, we are all praying and thinking about you now. 

I read all of your regrets, all of your feelings and I will do my best to use them to help shape my life. You mention not being able to pass on life lessons, but I think there are a few in this post and I listened to them, I will follow them. I am glad it sounds like you have made some peace with death, which I am relieved to hear. 

The world is crazy right now and so much is virtual, but you have so many people here who will be with you until the end - me included.

I remember what Roger Ebert said about consciousness existing beyond our physical lives. He said that he was perfectly content before he was born and expected to be perfectly content after he died. That's what I feel about death. I remember the few times that I've had full anesthesia. It's not like sleeping. It's one second you're counting backwards, and then bang you're in recovery. No sense of time passing, no dreams, no sleeping. Just bang, gone. I think death will be like that. It's not sleep - it's just non-existence. Like before you were born.

I thought it was her alzheimer's talking but her nurse said ""I guess it's almost time for her"". Since then, I've experienced so many weird things like that.

So don't feel alone. Somebody is out there guiding you or perhaps has been waiting for you. I used to be an atheist but being a healthcare provider changed that completely. Just have seen too much strange things that cannot be explained through science and logic.

I'm tearing up whilst I write this because the suffering you've gone through is immeasurable but you still found the time to write your final statement to the world and it's helping so many people. You gripped my attention and I felt so sad knowing at some point the paragraphs would end.

You may have struggled in life, but at least you got a say in your final moments, I hope you make it to Tuesday at least if it's not too painful, just so you get to understand and be in this world a little longer and appreciate how amazing it is to be actually alive.

He used to work on the shipyards in the Navy, back when asbestos wasn't so looked badly upon.

I haven't commented before, because well I'm not a doctor, child of a doc, I'm a former EMT and now disabled chronic pain patient from a genetic disorder, who sometimes comes here for advice, but mostly to watch as others get answers and to learn as I never wanted to stop learning.But today you have taught all of us. Not just doctors, but us as humans. I had read your posts, hoping you would receive good palliative care. It seems they got that managed and have given you choices. I am sad that not everyone gets that.

I think about the impacts it could have had in other cases like yours and others. My mother likely had the genetic disorder I have that doesn't go away, but because she was cut off cold turkey from all pain management back at the beginning of the opioid crisis, she instead shot herself. I can't help but think that palliative care in some situations should be recognized as a human right. It hurts me to hear your story of the person given a pain pump, but the doctor didn't even recognize someone could be too ill to press such a pump. This is the importance of looking at the human as a whole in care.

,,,,"We're here with you brother. Your strength is unmatched by any of us. You're a warrior right now, and if you feel like taking a rest, you have every right to do so. Thank you for taking this time to share with us the truth you are seeing. It is out duty to take your words and apply it to our lives. 

Thank you for putting money, time, work, and relationships in perspective for us. Your words are healing us that are suffering through ignorance and blindness to the ultimate truth, and thank you for reminding us of the gift that life is, and that we tend not to see on a day to day basis. 

(This is my personal perspective and I share for the possibility that these words offer any consolation.) In my personal spiritual practice I have seen that our essence (consciousness/the soul) is everpresent and unconditional love. Yes this body will leave this world but YOU are infinite awareness and love. Once this body goes, you remain as the infinite love that you are and always have been. You will return to the state of absolute bliss that is your natural state and come back when you feel like you want to experience another life. 

Sending you all the love in my heart right now. You're not alone. You're never alone. Your mind may say otherwise but you are loved and will always be loved. Ultimate love gave you this life for you to explore, discover and be and do whatever you want without judgement and you did exactly that. God does not judge. He wants us to experience this life (playground) however we want. You banged out 41 years like a boss knocked it out the park. Good job man. 

I love you man. Open your heart. Forgive yourself if possible/necessary. This life is hard and you lived it. I'm proud of you for all that you have done. No judgement. Just love you for being you. 

Be well and rest your heart in love brother. We're all here with you. (God/the universe) unconditional love is holding you in his arms right now as he has always been since the day baby you came to this planet. He will continue to hold you in his unconditional love infinitely after this body leaves this planet. Thank you for sharing your heart during this time. Wishing you find/do/receive anything that your heart is yearning for at this moment.

i'm not much for religion, but i do pray in my own way; i will be praying for your comfort in this process. i believe in reincarnation, and so i pray that you could come back around in another form, to greet us all again, to fulfill wishes from this life in another.

it's hard to know what to say; i wanted to try anyways, because your post impacted me profoundly. THANK YOU for this wake-up call. 

i don't wish to overshare, but when i was 14 i got extremely sick; doctors told my parents that i would likely die within a week. my illness was much less absolute than yours, though. there were some botched surgeries, sepsis, ICU time, and other close calls, but i managed to survive.

since then, though, i've been stagnating. even with the first hand experience of coding out and nearly dying, i have just... been reckless with my health, my life, my decisions. even i don't understand it fully, but my best guess is that i just feel ""invincible,"" like nothing really matters.

&#x200B;

I am moved by your words. I cannot understand what you are going trough, but you are a wonderful person and your teachings about life will be with me. I am younger than you, I am 23, but is thanks to people like you that everyone can and must aspire to be a better person. 

I will tell you a tale I red some time ago. I had a terrible fear of dying, and I still have sorta, but I am managing to use it as a way to live better. So, I bought a book that was about the death and the fact that we should accept it as natural, written by Irvine Yalom. It contained a story that told about a wealthy man who was dying. On the death bed there were three figures, Wealth, Money and Fame, or similar ( I can't remember right now the exact metaphores, but I hope you could catch the sense). The dying man asked if they were coming with him, but they said no, they could not. But then it came the Good Actions, who held the hand of the man and flew away with him. Well, from my point of view you just did this and I am so glad I red your posts and this farewell. I will keep a place for you and your words in my heart. 

See you on the other side, Robert. I hope when my day comes I will be as sharp and as caring as you are.

,,,,"Hello Robert. 

I do not think that you'll read this among the 1.300 comments but it did not feel right to not respond to your post.

My mother died on the 29 of october this year from lung cancer. Much like you, she smoked since she was 18 years old. I often told her that she needs to quit but it was in vein. My mother quit smoking on the day she was hospitalized - but it was already too late. She came into the hospital because she couldnt move her legs anymore. After much tests it was found out that tumor tissue in her spinal cord was the reason. The tissue spread from her lung into the spinal cord and from there into the brain. She was hospitalized on the 08 of September. Six weeks later she died in here own home - in here own living Room with her husband and her three children by her side till the last breath.

I want to thank you for your Post. I couldnt stop the tears coming from my eyes whilst reading your Text. I too have smoked for nearly 13 years - a pack of cigeretters a day. I quit roughly three weeks before my mother was hospitalized, in mid august. After my mother died I promised myself that I'd never Touch a cigerette in my life again. Thanks to you I'll have two reasons now. 

I hope your last hours will be as peaceful as my mothers were. Thank you for letting me share my story. I wish you all the best up there and greet my mother. I'll never forget this thread and your name - Robert.

I'll say farewell to you Robert with a quote that helped me the past two weeks. Till me meet in the afterlife.

I forgive you. I forgive you poor decisions made in the depths of disease. I forgive you the fact that your disease led to so much frustration, guilt, anxiety, concern, and hard feelings.

From all these people, me included, who want you to know you're not alone here.

Thank you for sharing this with everyone here at reddit (and I'm sure, in the future, those who will read a news article about this thread). I think I speak for everyone here when I say this, we appreciate having the chance to be here with you to the end, even as impersonal as these little tidbits of text we leave are. I hope we can all bring you at least a smidge of comfort, maybe even make you crack a little smile with the strength you have left. 

I wish someone could be at your side with you. Having these thousands of people here though? That's...that's something else. Not only do you have someone by your side to your peaceful sleep, you have *thousands* of people by your side to bring you there, and there's something...magical about that. Meaningful. Hopeful, even. 

It gives me hope we can all come together one day, and treat each other with the same level of compassion I'm seeing here. I hope you pass with sweet thoughts and dreams in your mind, and/or a smile on your face.

Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.

,,,,"I already posted earlier expressing many of the thoughts I hoped to convey, but in the hopes you read this as well, I am posting this as its own comment.

In my earlier comment, I mentioned that you have surely changed many lives for the better. I would like to add that you may have changed mine. I know that in the grand scheme of things, some of my aspirations are largely selfish. I love cars, I enjoy driving them, and I naturally get a thrill from accelerating faster than strictly necessary, and taking turns faster than than is perfectly comfortable (all while avoiding putting innocent people in any danger, of course. I'm not that selfish.) 

You are right in that it is best to enjoy your life, however strangely it may be, so long as it doesn't hurt others. I had been considering trying to race (on a track) once COVID is over, and going to a racing school. Your post has made me realize I should definitely try to pursue this, as life isn't forever, and when my time comes, I would at least know that I tried to pursue something I enjoy, whether or not I succeed. Thank you for making me realize this.

Another thing I mentioned in my earlier comment is that for average people that aren't Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar, the best way to live forever and be remembered is to be kind. I still stand by that statement, but I would like to add to that. Those people aren't remembered because they were kind, far from it,  but because the changes they made in the world are easily quantified. The changes you have made are not so easily measured, and while you will not be remembered by all for taking power in Rome, you will be remembered by the people here that have read your kind words, and that is no less memorable and no less important.",1.0,"['i', 'already', 'posted', 'earlier', 'expressing', 'many', 'of', 'the', 'thought', 'i', 'hoped', 'to', 'convey', 'but', 'in', 'the', 'hope', 'you', 'read', 'this', 'a', 'well', 'i', 'am', 'posting', 'this', 'a', 'it', 'own', 'comment', 'in', 'my', 'earlier', 'comment', 'i', 'mentioned', 'that', 'you', 'have', 'surely', 'changed', 'many', 'life', 'for', 'the', 'better', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'add', 'that', 'you', 'may', 'have', 'changed', 'mine', 'i', 'know', 'that', 'in', 'the', 'grand', 'scheme', 'of', 'thing', 'some', 'of', 'my', 'aspiration', 'are', 'largely', 'selfish', 'i', 'love', 'car', 'i', 'enjoy', 'driving', 'them', 'and', 'i', 'naturally', 'get', 'a', 'thrill', 'from', 'accelerating', 'faster', 'than', 'strictly', 'necessary', 'and', 'taking', 'turn', 'faster', 'than', 'than', 'is', 'perfectly', 'comfortable', 'all', 'while', 'avoiding', 'putting', 'innocent', 'people', 'in', 'any', 'danger', 'of', 'course', 'i', 'not', 'that', 'selfish', 'you', 'are', 'right', 'in', 'that', 'it', 'is', 'best', 'to', 'enjoy', 'your', 'life', 'however', 'strangely', 'it', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'long', 'a', 'it', 'doe', 'hurt', 'others', 'i', 'had', 'been', 'considering', 'trying', 'to', 'race', 'on', 'a', 'track', 'once', 'covid', 'is', 'over', 'and', 'going', 'to', 'a', 'racing', 'school', 'your', 'post', 'ha', 'made', 'me', 'realize', 'i', 'should', 'definitely', 'try', 'to', 'pursue', 'this', 'a', 'life', 'is', 'forever', 'and', 'when', 'my', 'time', 'come', 'i', 'would', 'at', 'least', 'know', 'that', 'i', 'tried', 'to', 'pursue', 'something', 'i', 'enjoy', 'whether', 'or', 'not', 'i', 'succeed', 'thank', 'you', 'for', 'making', 'me', 'realize', 'this', 'another', 'thing', 'i', 'mentioned', 'in', 'my', 'earlier', 'comment', 'is', 'that', 'for', 'average', 'people', 'that', 'are', 'alexander', 'the', 'great', 'or', 'julius', 'caesar', 'the', 'best', 'way', 'to', 'live', 'forever', 'and', 'be', 'remembered', 'is', 'to', 'be', 'kind', 'i', 'still', 'stand', 'by', 'that', 'statement', 'but', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'add', 'to', 'that', 'those', 'people', 'are', 'remembered', 'because', 'they', 'were', 'kind', 'far', 'from', 'it', 'but', 'because', 'the', 'change', 'they', 'made', 'in', 'the', 'world', 'are', 'easily', 'quantified', 'the', 'change', 'you', 'have', 'made', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'measured', 'and', 'while', 'you', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'remembered', 'by', 'all', 'for', 'taking', 'power', 'in', 'rome', 'you', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'by', 'the', 'people', 'here', 'that', 'have', 'read', 'your', 'kind', 'word', 'and', 'that', 'is', 'no', 'less', 'memorable', 'and', 'no', 'less', 'important']"

When the blood creeps, and the nerves prick
And tingle; and the heart is sick,
And all the wheels of Being slow.

Be near me when the sensuous frame
Is rack'd with pangs that conquer trust;
And Time, a maniac scattering dust,
And Life, a fury slinging flame.

Be near me when my faith is dry,
And men the flies of latter spring,
That lay their eggs, and sting and sing
And weave their petty cells and die.

Be near me when I fade away,
To point the term of human strife,
And on the low dark verge of life
The twilight of eternal day.

There’s a slight bit of jealousy in my mind, envious that you get to see (or not) what happens (or doesn’t) once our bodies die. I am so curious about that.

There is thankfulness, and yet another bit of wavering, but 100% committed-to resolve. To break from chasing “green papers and metal discs”.

This is so sad.

The user had never been verified.

The hospice nurse bypassed the protection lock on the user’s phone, entered his Reddit account in violation of the terms of service, and allegedly posted her own message under his account name. A poetic act of duty that would never be carried out, since it is not only a violation of her patient’s privacy, but also could potentially get her fired. Even if she had, the notion she would have signed it with her first name and last initial is preposterous.

Patient said every breath was harder than the last, yet spent his time composing a huge message with professional-level grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Surprisingly polished for a junkie on his way out, channeling his inner Randy Pausch we are to suppose.

The doula and the patient use the same sentence structure, same construction, and the same mannerisms. Some of the ideas were clipped short in the second post to try to hide this, but not all.  The spelling of patient’s first name, which under no circumstances would ever be released publicly, especially given his prescription history, was altered once to give the impression that it wasn’t the original author in that the caregiver was somehow unsure of it and also somehow alarmingly non-detail-oriented for a nurse.

This post followed hard after three other suspicious position anecdote posts. Two emphasized and seemed to even embellish the seriousness of covid symptoms. One other turned end-of-life care into a horror story about a patient ripping his own fingernails out, leading the readers to conclude the need for death with dignity/ assisted suicide laws in preparation for an organized push for federal legislation.

Firstly, I hope these messages shine bright and far, like the light of Earendil, as though you were holding now the glass phial from Galadriel herself of the most beloved star. Hold it close to you now, in your mind, shining warm and bright and comforting.

Secondly, I've always felt this moment from Lord of the Rings really helped me look at my own departure with a small measure of comfort too. When things are at their darkest, enveloped in fear, Pippin turns to Gandalf and says, ""I didn't think it would end this way.""Gandalf responds, ""End? No. the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass. And then you see it."" Pippin curiously replies, ""What? Gandalf, see what?"" and Gandalf wisely smiles back and replies, ""White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise."" Pippin, with some relief replies ""Well, that isn't so bad."" And Gandalf reassures him, ""No, no it isn't.""

May you find peace under a swift sunrise, passing onto whatever next realm there is to be found. Thank you friend for your courage, wisdom, and me and my 3 kitties are sending you light and love.

“Death is an old friend waiting at the end of a life well-lived. It can’t be appreciated in darkness.”

Suddenly, after all these years, I feel differently about death. I feel that there is peace and rest for our souls and for our toils.

,,,,"Hi Robert,

I’m not sure if you are still with us at the moment, but I nevertheless wanted to leave you with a warm statement from my favorite philosopher, Epicurus. The following letter was written on the day of his death to one of his dearest friends:

**Letter to Idomeneus:**
“I write this to you while experiencing a blessedly happy day, and at the same time the last day of my life. Urinary blockages and dysenteric discomforts afflict me which could not be surpassed for their intensity. But against all of these things are ranged the joy in my soul produced by the recollection of the discussions we have had. Please take care of the children of Metrodorus in a manner worthy of the good disposition you have had since adolescence towards me and towards philosophy”

Epicurus died a slow and painful death, but nevertheless considered the last day of his life to be a blessed one. Not because his life was coming to a close, but because of the joy he was able to glean from his memories. If you’re still with us, I hope you can rest easy recalling all of the kind people in this subreddit who are here for you. Likewise, I hope anyone who reads this and feels currently in pain or distress takes some level of comfort from my post.

All the best.",1.0,"['hi', 'robert', 'i', 'm', 'not', 'sure', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'still', 'with', 'u', 'at', 'the', 'moment', 'but', 'i', 'nevertheless', 'wanted', 'to', 'leave', 'you', 'with', 'a', 'warm', 'statement', 'from', 'my', 'favorite', 'philosopher', 'epicurus', 'the', 'following', 'letter', 'wa', 'written', 'on', 'the', 'day', 'of', 'his', 'death', 'to', 'one', 'of', 'his', 'dearest', 'friend', 'letter', 'to', 'idomeneus', 'i', 'write', 'this', 'to', 'you', 'while', 'experiencing', 'a', 'blessedly', 'happy', 'day', 'and', 'at', 'the', 'same', 'time', 'the', 'last', 'day', 'of', 'my', 'life', 'urinary', 'blockage', 'and', 'dysenteric', 'discomfort', 'afflict', 'me', 'which', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'surpassed', 'for', 'their', 'intensity', 'but', 'against', 'all', 'of', 'these', 'thing', 'are', 'ranged', 'the', 'joy', 'in', 'my', 'soul', 'produced', 'by', 'the', 'recollection', 'of', 'the', 'discussion', 'we', 'have', 'had', 'please', 'take', 'care', 'of', 'the', 'child', 'of', 'metrodorus', 'in', 'a', 'manner', 'worthy', 'of', 'the', 'good', 'disposition', 'you', 'have', 'had', 'since', 'adolescence', 'towards', 'me', 'and', 'towards', 'philosophy', 'epicurus', 'died', 'a', 'slow', 'and', 'painful', 'death', 'but', 'nevertheless', 'considered', 'the', 'last', 'day', 'of', 'his', 'life', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'blessed', 'one', 'not', 'because', 'his', 'life', 'wa', 'coming', 'to', 'a', 'close', 'but', 'because', 'of', 'the', 'joy', 'he', 'wa', 'able', 'to', 'glean', 'from', 'his', 'memory', 'if', 'you', 're', 'still', 'with', 'u', 'i', 'hope', 'you', 'can', 'rest', 'easy', 'recalling', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'kind', 'people', 'in', 'this', 'subreddit', 'who', 'are', 'here', 'for', 'you', 'likewise', 'i', 'hope', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'this', 'and', 'feel', 'currently', 'in', 'pain', 'or', 'distress', 'take', 'some', 'level', 'of', 'comfort', 'from', 'my', 'post', 'all', 'the', 'best']"

I wanted to tell you, you have the heart and soul of a poet. don't worry about receiving the gift of forgiveness from others, before you go, but *please forgive yourself*. 

how would any of us be remembered if we were judged by our worst day? 

people find reasons to become better versions of themselves all the time. sometimes they hit rock bottom and lose everything they love before they are ready to make that change. sometimes it's for a positive reason, like having a baby and they want to be better for them. 

sometimes it's an unexpected death sentence that urges them to make themselves better while they still hold onto that precious gift of life they have left. 

no one reason is better than another. nothing makes the change more or less valid. you are clearly thankful you have time at ALL, when any one of us could die in a tragic accident instantaneously, with no opportunity to make amends. 

I am so proud of you for reaching out. not facing this alone. no one deserves to be alone in their final moments. I don't know you, but know that I love you. it will be okay. this too shall pass. 

one thing that helps me not be afraid of death, is the knowledge that you don't have to know how to do it. everyone before you has done it. and everyone after you will eventually do it as well. you're about to learn the answer to life's greatest mystery!

I hope you know that we as a community are here with you if not in person then in our hearts and spirit. I'm not sure what to say but as a Lord of the Rings fan, a quote that resonates best with me in regards to death is the comfort that Gandalf tells Pippin.

PIPPIN: I didn't think it would end this way.

GANDALF: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it.

PIPPIN: What? Gandalf? See what?

GANDALF: White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise.

PIPPIN: Well, that isn't so bad.

GANDALF: No. No, it isn't

I hope you find comfort in the rest of your days and one day when it is my turn to pass, I will see you in that far green country and we can share our tales and lessons we've learned along the way.

Oh, Great Spirit, whose voice I hear in the wind, whose breath gives life to all the world. 

Hear me; I need your strength and wisdom. 

Let me walk in beauty, and make my eyes ever behold the red and purple sunset. 

Make my hands respect the things you have made and my ears sharp to hear your voice. 

Make me wise so that I may understand the things you have taught my people. 

Help me to remain calm and strong in the face of all that comes towards me. 

Let me learn the lessons you have hidden in every leaf and rock. 

Help me seek pure thoughts and act with the intention of helping others. 

Help me find compassion without empathy overwhelming me. 

I seek strength, not to be greater than my brother, but to fight my greatest enemy, Myself. 

Make me always ready to come to you with clean hands and straight eyes. 

So when life fades, as the fading sunset, my spirit may come to you without shame.

It's a tragedy that the vast majority of us only seem to reach this pinnacle when our own mortality is dropped on our heads. Buddhist monks attempt to mimic mortal threat in order to achieve this pinnacle before death is imminent. I wonder how successful any of them ever really are.

What is it about consciousness that can't seem to not take for granted all of the little things that make life sweet? What is it about consciousness that clings to all of the little things that niggle against it? I suppose it's the negativity bias that kept us alive in the brush. Boy, has it backfired. 

I hope that for your last few days, you utterly bask in this golden feeling. For most of us, it's impossible to reach it without standing where you're standing now. Bathe in it, friend. Feed from it greedily

,,,,"This post came randomly on my feed and I’m not even the type of person to leave any comments on these types of platforms, but I felt compelled when I read this post. I don’t know what the original post says, but this really hit me deeply. I have never cried and ached this much for a complete stranger that I don’t even know what they look like. 

First off, I want to tell you that you are an amazing soul and if I could have any one wish right now, it would for you. I literally had put my phone down to pray for you. I have a few auto immune diseases and heart condition. Although I am doing alright at the moment, I worry about those unpredictable flare ups that could be my last. When I was 17, I was given 6-8 months to live at one point which you would think make me appreciate life so much more. But I was a stupid depressed kid. I am grateful that I still survived to be 34 today. 

I lost the best grandmother to suicide 2 years ago and just this past August, lost my grandfather to cancer. Everything happened to fast. What hurts most is because there was family issues, we did not stay connected until the very end. By that time he was so weak. I still cannot get over that he had left me a beautiful message and picture literally a day before he passed, but I never got it because I had blocked him on that platform. My mom finally saw the messages and sent them to me when she was going through his phone after he passed. Now the guilt of feeling that he thought I was ignoring him when he was trying to reach out to me and just tell me he loves me which has always been difficult for a guy like him. 

I always feel heavy regret in my heart for both my grandparents as there was so much more I feel I could have done. I will never feel peace, because they never left peacefully. It will always hurt and never not because of the details of how and what had happened. 

I can’t I cannot stop crying typing this. Your post is so eye opening. I am deeply moved in many ways. And I want you to know that you are so loved. Even with the shorter lifespan that I already have, if I could take a year out of my life to give to you, Robert S, I would. Why? Because I also know you would treat it so much more precious than me. I now feel the urgency to do better and get out there and do more. 

I have a husband that is amazing and a son that was a miracle baby, yet I take them for granted and let my anxiety get the best of me, so they get the worst of me. They deserve so much better. They deserve someone that gives them as much as they give me. They are my whole world but I realize I need to treat them as such. I need to make it a point to make everlasting memories with them because that’s what will be the best gift I could give them when I’m gone. I just want to say thank you for writing this. It’s honestly one of the most touching things. And I read a LOT of difference things. 

I hope you are comfortable and can smile knowing you really made a difference in this little family. And again, you are SOO loved. I hope you can see it, I hope you can feel it!

,,,,"Dear Robert, dear friend, brother, 

I will remember you. Thousands of people will remember you.

Go on with peace and the courage you have demonstrated. You have shared yourself with the world in all ways possible in the end.

Your life lessons will not be forgotten. They have reached far and wide, to other countries and continents. 

It seems that you have found peace, and for that I am grateful, as we all are here.

I'll think of you till the end. Nobody knows where you're going, whether as you beautifully put it it'll be a nice long siesta or something else.

Whatever it is, know you have a family with you. We will mourn your departure from this world and celebrate the imprint and legacy you have left for it. 
Cosmopolitan in Greek philosophy means, people of the cosmos, in reality, that is primarily what we all are, people of the cosmos, of the world, in that I am your brother, in that, everyone on here feeling for you, thinking of you, everyone here is your family in a way that is true on a foundamental level. 

You are not alone. 

Worry not, for the sufficiency of your letters, take the time and energy to forgive yourself first and foremost, before you pass on. You deserve it, we all make mistakes, the fact you've come to terms with them and in the end wanted to make amends is sufficient, you can forgive yourself now. Truly. 

Whoever reads your letters will, I am sure in their own time forgive you too. 

Your father no matter what has happened between you, already forgives you, and has never stopped loving you.

To your father I say, to be proud, for the courage his son has demonstrated in the end is the most noble and human way to leave this life, and for the depth of the words he shared with the world. Words may last longer than life in the right circumstances, they outlive us, your son's legacy lives on through his words. Forgive yourself also, do not guilt yourself, your son was not alone, he has felt love to the end, and has known in his deepest core that you'd always forgive him in the end, that you'd always love him. 

The last words of Robert, estranged brother from another part of the world, words of wisdom and love will remain with me, with us forever. I thank you, for sharing with us your very being in the end, the thoughts in your mind and the feeling of your soul.

Tout mon amour et ma compassion mon Frère.

,,,,"There is always hope, and if I might share my experiences with cancer I will explain why. I hope you will hear me out. I was diagnosed with gamma delta t-cell hepatosplenic lymphoma about 5 years ago and even through my treatment i found myself smoking. One of the first things to go was my spleen, followed by my bone marrow in a BMT and finally my hips because of the extensive steroids associated with the treatment. Eventually it found its way to my lungs and then something was seen on my heart. If not for the miracle of receiving immunotherapy I probably wouldn't have made it through it, but even with that I cant explain the things I have survived. That immunotherapy almost killed me, it reacted severely with my BMT causing a severe immune response, and right now I am living longer than just about everyone who has this type of cancer (at least that was according to my doctors). After years of addiction, going from cigarettes to alcohol to marijuana and finally abusing the painkillers that were prescribed for my pain I finally hit a true low point in all of it. Since I was abusing my pain meds they became less effective and With my arthritis (from the steroids) the pain in my joints was unbearable. In that bed of pain with no relief I found myself calling to God and in his mercy he gave me the grace to overcome everything. I got off all the pain pills, off of the immune suppressants and steroids and all of my medication. He gave me miracle after miracle and it was there, devoting myself to consuming his word and learning as much as I could about him that I realized he was pulling me through it all. Through those countless weeks spent in the hospital for my treatment, through my loneliness, through not connecting to a single other cancer patient, through my addiction, through my cancer, through the pain. It is where I find myself now and I am so thankful for it. He does miracles friend. There is good news for those who will hear it, with Christ Jesus there is life and healing. He if there for those that will hear his call and He is close to the broken hearted. He has a promise of healing of our brokenness, forgiveness for our sins and eternal life with him. You need only believe on him as God, believe he rose from the dead and paid for your sins. I will be praying for you and your recovery, and that he finds you as well.

,,,,"I'm having one of the worst weeks in recent memory and am having trouble doing anything I want and just being paralyzed by everything I need to do and even want to do--things I like, love, and am passionate about. My two amazing partners are on the verge of meltdown from their lives outside the house. I'm also in quite a bit of pain after a diagnostic procedure yesterday and having to come to terms with going from my rare kidney disorder ""not causing any major new problems for years"" to ""I may end up having to cath myself multiple times a day for the rest of my life"". I'm only in my late 20's and after the pain of the diagnostic procedure and the pain I've had since, that possibility terrifies me. I don't want to live in this pain for the rest of my life because I'm constantly having to shove a tube into my bladder just to finish peeing so I don't run the risk of an infection going back through my broken valves and destroying what's left of my mostly working 1 kidney and the pretty much dead other one.

...But your post...your post has reached through the fog of misery I've been in today and grabbed both my heart and mind I wasn't expecting. I do have support in my life, ranging from an amazing chosen family to a biological and legal one. I am told I'm intelligent and talented enough to do amazing things, though I have imposter syndrome. But your post reminded me that I have time. I'm not resigned to my feared life situation. Not yet. But just as that isn't certain, neither is my life and exactly how much time I have left. As sad as it is to think about, I have more time than you and I owe it to myself and the people I care about to bring all I have to this life while I'm still in it. And in a weird way, by the time I finished your post, I feel like I owe to you and your memory. Someone I have never met, somewhere unknown on this planet in their home and in their final moments...and I'm thinking about them; wondering how they're doing at each second that passes with each word I type and whether they're sleeping or resting with a piece of technology in front of them that has connected them and spread their legacy to distances and people they don't know. 

Over 20K humans connected to them by one of the most fundamental truths and emotions of humanity: we all must die and love and support for those who must leave us to continue on our journeys in this world with one less soul wandering around with us. It's one of the most amazing things I've seen, Robert. The amount of love, support, and connection and inspiration you've brought about within the last half day on this post alone, despite reviewing your life as wasted, is awesome--with all the weight on the ""awe"". You may have considered much your life not great, but in my very humble opinion, you've lived an incredible last week and there are thousands of people who will carry you with them for the rest of their lives. And some will even pass you down to younger generations when they talk about ""that my [family member] read the final words on Reddit of someone named ""Robert"" who inspired them to pull themselves out of anxiety, depression, and crippled executive function to try and live happily again in one of the worst years of their lives"". With any luck, like a cherished family teddy bear from when an ancestor was young, they'll pass you down too to be a source of inspiration or at least introspection on if they are living their life they way they really want.

I am glad to have the opportunity to be among those people. I've known of you for less than half and hour, but as you stated pretty upfront, we already must say goodbye. Goodbye, Robert. If you are still with us, I hope you're still comfortable. If you're not, then we can take solace in you not having to be in that much pain again.

I'm going to go listen to this now. I feel it's appropriate. https://youtu.be/6Q0sMOQvJuw

,,,,"You have mentioned religion and books you have read, but if only I could come and spare some time with you. Should you manage to read this, as I pray you have the time, I hope that I can impart some faith unto you. How I wish I could convince of you God, through my experiences of those of others, but I know that is not the way. For many have claimed to have met God or to have heard a message from him. Faith does not come from me or what I tell you, but from God. 

That's why I come to bring you the message that he did not speak to me, but to the world. There is a Loving God. There truly is. 

The reason for the existence of evil is simple. We are evil. That's a strong assessment truly. But if there was a perfect God, which there is, surely a single imperfection, regardless of severity, would be an insult to him. This is the bad news. We are all evil at heart. None of us have righteousness. We may have done good in our lives, but a criminal in court is not judged by their good deeds, but their evil ones. 

How then is a man to make it to heaven? We are all wicked to the core and unable to clean ourselves. Even if we were to go on ceasing from our wicked ways surely we cannot erase the errors of our past. This is true. We cannot erase the errors of our past. However, someone else can. That loving God can come down and give you a new heart. A new righteousness. A new path to be reconciled with him. No more will that evil which is in your heart past present and future define you. You can wear the righteousness of God and be brought back in as a true son. 

How can God give us a new righteousness if our evil must be punished. For surely as someone in a court must pay for their crimes, surely someone in the court of God must pay for their unrighteousness. Just as in a court someone can pay your bail, God can pay yours as well. This was done through the sacrificing of his own Son, Jesus Christ. For Jesus Christ gave up his heavenly throne and came down to live as a man. Through his years on Earth he was tempted, as are all men, but he never gave in to sin. Because he was righteous, he was able to die, so that his righteousness can be passed on to us. Because Jesus was and is God he rose from the dead, and has promised that all who die believing in him shall also rise from the dead and live him and his Father for eternity. 

There is no promise I can make except that if you accept Jesus Christ as your savior, that he died on the cross for your sins and rose from the dead, that he is truly the living Son of God, that you may inherit eternal life. I pray that you do not dismiss what I have written on the premise that is 'merely' the Christian tale. For surely it has been proclaimed profusely for the last 2000 years, yet hardly I come across people who know it. I know that there may be not much time left, but there is one God. The only way to be reconciled back unto him is through his Son. I pray that you will accept his Son and in turn be accepted unto God as a son of God as well. For the alternative is much to horrible to even wish to think about. I do not promise that Jesus Christ will heal you, but he will save you. Though you will die one day in your earthly body, you will once again have a body provided by God. A body made of heavenly things which will never age, never feel pain, and be perfect in every way. Pray unto God and save your soul. For those who repent and believe in the Son of God will be saved.",1.0,"['you', 'have', 'mentioned', 'religion', 'and', 'book', 'you', 'have', 'read', 'but', 'if', 'only', 'i', 'could', 'come', 'and',

As I read about the nicotine patch and cigarettes it dawned on me that you’re only 4 years older than my significant other. He smokes. He quit a while ago for a few years, and then started again. We have our first child on the way. He doesn’t have health insurance because it’s too expensive where we live for a small business owner to have.

Laborers in the Vineyard

20 “For the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of an estate who went out in the morning at dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard. 2 When he had agreed with the laborers for a [a]denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. 3 And he went out about the third hour (9:00 a.m.) and saw others standing idle in the market place; 4 and he said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right (an appropriate wage).’ And they went. 5 He went out about the sixth hour (noon) and the ninth hour (3:00 p.m.), and did the same thing. 6 And about the eleventh hour (5:00 p.m.) he went out and found others standing around, and he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’ 7 They answered him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He told them, ‘You go into the vineyard also.’

8 “When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last [to be hired] and ending with the first [to be hired].’(A) 9 Those who had been hired at the eleventh hour (5:00 p.m.) came and received a denarius each [a day’s wage]. 10 Now when the first [to be hired] came, they thought they would get more; but each of them also received a denarius. 11 When they received it, they protested and grumbled at the owner of the estate, 12 saying, ‘These men who came last worked [only] one hour, and yet you have made them equal [in wages] to us who have carried [most of] the burden and [worked in] the scorching heat of the day.’ 13 But the owner of the estate replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no injustice. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? 14 Take what belongs to you and go, but I choose to give to this last man [hired] the same as I give to you. 15 Am I not lawfully permitted to do what I choose with what is mine? Or is your eye [b]envious because I am generous?’ 16 So those who are last [in this world] shall be first [in the world to come], and those who are first, last.”

May you find grace and comfort in Jesus’ words to the thief on the cross:

Luke 23:39-43
Then one of the criminals hanging there began to yell insults at Him: “Aren’t You the Messiah? Save Yourself and us!”
But the other answered, rebuking him: “Don’t you even fear God, since you are undergoing the same punishment? We are punished justly, because we’re getting back what we deserve for the things we did, but this man has done nothing wrong.” Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!”

I am not sure how this ended up as a blip on my Reddits to read, but somehow I know it was meant to be. Driving tonight, I was exiting the freeway and within seconds before a man about my age (38) was just hit and drug along on his motorcycle by a heavy duty truck. I was only tipped off by a shoe in the road and then came up on a black piece of metal. Barricades, constructions cones all around creating chaos on the roadway. I exited because I had gotten a warning that the freeway was closed up ahead. Once I saw the mental I came to a screeching stop, hoping the vehicles behind me would too. The man still lying on the ground with noone around. No helmet. Running on adrenaline, he asked me the same few questions over and over again. He lived. 

And I come home to read this. It makes me incredibly sad, but I am in awe of life. This post has me speechless. How someone in your situation could have such a beautiful outlook, hopes and wishes for others. I just wish that it wasn't the loss of life that made us realize how special and precious time is.

Socrates said something similar to what you said in his last speech and it is extremely profound. 

""Either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another...Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain...For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this think that any man... even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night.
But if death is the journey to another place...What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again. I myself, too, shall have a wonderful interest in there meeting and conversing with...any other ancient hero who has suffered death through an unjust judgment; and there will be no small pleasure, as I think, in comparing my own sufferings with theirs... Above all, I shall then be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in the next; and I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is not...
Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know of a certainty, that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death... 
Still I have a favour to ask of them. When my sons are grown up, I would ask you, O my friends, to punish them... if they seem to care about riches, or anything, more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something when they are really nothing,—then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about that for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something when they are really nothing. And if you do this, both I and my sons will have received justice at your hands. 

The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways—I to die, and you to live.

So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us.""

You've just passed a bunch of wisdom onto thousands of people.  Not your offspring, but people you've now shaped in some way, nonetheless.

There's so many things I wish you could tell us about your life, but I know you don't have the time or strength for all that.  But if you could tell us one of your favourite moments, or something you did that made you the most proud in life... I would like that.  (Or vent some dark stuff, if that's what you feel like doing, but I think the good things you've done are worth preserving in words – so they are not lost.)

,,,,"Hello, I found your post on the front page. Know that I will be thinking about you and so will many others. You've taken time to read about the beliefs of the afterlife from different cultures. Have you ever listened to the Bible? Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are the gospels, please start with [Matthew](https://youtu.be/_hBeW2ngRcw?t=100). 

Please take a look at my family's website [here.](https://www.jesussaidwhat.com/) 

John 14:1-6 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.

Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

&#x200B;

John 3:16-18 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

Isaiah 55:6-11

Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:

Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.

For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:

,,,,"Hey my man, I just want to throw in my two cents and say that you are loved, valuable, and worth all of the caring and compassion as the rest of us.

You, deep down, are good people. It's obvious. You have love, and kindness, and forgiveness in your heart. No one can aspire to more than that.

I know this is a bit macabre to bring up, but I too have struggled my whole life with mental health and addiction problems, that were only made worse later in life by PTSD.

I have attempted suicide several times, and while I am (many years later) now grateful that I am still here, I just want you to know that I did succeed once... I was dead. Several minutes from what I was told. While I don't remember it from the outside, I *do* remember it from the inside.

Don't be afraid. While the idea seems scary to almost all of us, the reality of it is not. 

It is absolute peace. Absolute comfort. Absolute tranquility. 

In those brief few minutes, I dwelled endlessly in my happiest moments. I got to relive them for as long and as intensely as I wanted.

I'm not sure if you can relate, but perhaps you know those nights when you lie awake in bed. Praying for sleep. Yet your mind tortures you by looping some insignificant (in the grand scheme) memory that caused you great pain or embarrassment. You lie there, wallowing in your own misery unable to just drift off and let it fade away.

Death is the diametrically opposed counterpart to this. You struggle to stay awake, to stay alive. Afraid to ""fall asleep"". Remembering and reliving all of the wonderful things in life that you don't want to leave... but that is the beautiful part of it.

Once you give in. Once you concede to let go. All of those reasons that you now suddenly realize made life wonderful and amazing just seep into you. They permeate your being.

You get to replay them. You get to experience them again. Every time just as intensely and vividly as they were the first time. You are left in comfortable solitude, in peace, without pain, without anxiety, without sorrow, destined to dance endlessly in the moments that brought joy into your heart while you lived.

I'm so sorry this is the hand you've been dealt. If there were anything in my power that could change it for you, please know that I would stop at nothing to do so.  

If you happen to make it this far into the comments and see this, I hope it brings you a bit of solace. Take it from someone who has been there. Death isn't the end. 

I only glimpsed the beginning of eternity... but it was every bit as incredible and amazing as any religion would have you believe ""heaven"" is. While I still fear leaving those who love and depend on me, I no longer fear death itself. It is but the next step in the greater journey that is as old as time itself.

God speed my friend. I will never forget your story. I will for the rest of my days, carry the name Robert S. in my mind, and in my heart.

,,,,"""The day is done, and the darkness

Falls from the wings of Night

As a feather is wafted downward

From an eagle in his flight.

I see the lights of the village

Gleam through the rain and the mist,

And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,

That my soul cannot resist:

A feeling of sadness and longing 

That is not akin to pain

And resembles sorrow only

As the mist resembles the rain. 

Come, read to me some poem 

Some simple and heartfelt lay 

That shall soothe this restless feeling 

And banish the thoughts of day.

Not from the grand old masters,

Not from the bards sublime,

Whose distant footsteps echo

Through the corridors of Time.

For, like strains of martial music,

Their mighty thoughts suggest

Life's endless toil and endeavor,

And tonight I long for rest.

Read from some humbler poet,

Whose songs gushed from his heart

As showers from the clouds of summer,

Or tears from the eyelids start;

Who, through long days of labor,

And nights devoid of ease,

Still heard in his soul the music 

Of wonderful melodies.

Such songs have the power to quiet

The restless pulse of care

And come like the benediction 

That follows after prayer.

Come, read from the treasured volume 

The poem of thy choice 

And lend to the rhyme of the poet

The beauty of thy voice.

And the night shall be filled with music,

And the cares that infest the day

Shall fold their tents like the Arabs

And as silently steal away.""

I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.

The last scud of day holds back for me,
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.

I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.

I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.

You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,
And filter and fibre your blood.

Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,
Missing me one place search another,
I stop somewhere waiting for you.

I ran and proceeded to hug those I love around me ! It was a tough day and after reading what you’ve been through I need to understand my life just isn’t that tough .  I’m happy you found your happiness and I’m pained to hear about your situation and still to this day don’t understand why certain things happen to people who have so much left to give. May your heart and soul rest peacefully.  Also to those who can’t seem to be happy with what you have just remember money and status aren’t everything in life . I’ll never own my own home but I have a place to live and people to love and that’s all that matters to me .  I live my life by the day thankful I’m somewhat healthy and given the opportunity to smile and have a good day .

If you are still here, reading these, I just wanted to add a small message of support, and perhaps comfort.

You were so personal there's no way I can't at least give you my real name and introduce myself properly. I've copied and pasted your post and have sent it to my personal email. I'm keeping that for the rest of my days, bro. Anyone I know who smokes is getting a copy of your letter. Hell, I might just copy a few dozen and leave them at spots where I see people smoking in my city. Your letter is galvanizing, and I just want to do something to make your words live on, even if its just a little bit. You may not realize it, but what you wrote made some serious waves. You said that you don't think consciousness survives death, and I agree. But I also think that it's impossible to experience non existence, leaving experience as the only possibility. I don't know what's next, but you're wrong bro, it's not over. May you have a peaceful passage to the next journey.  
You made a difference. Peace, Robert.

I am truly sorry for what you've had to go through. As an onlooker, it is beyond excruciating so I can only imagine what it's like in your shoes. I'm glad you've lived life as fully as you could though. And despite your many regrets, and wishes for things you would have done, you did live life fully. Maybe not in the ways you imagined you would, but through some means or another you put yourself into the world. Through all the trials and tribulations you worked to better yourself and it does matter.

Brother in humanity, the peace you are finding now is the door to the other side of peace. We live here on earth being tested and tested. Sometimes we fail, sometimes we pass. The most important tests are our finals. Whether you struggled on a few tests in the past, you are acing yours now. 

Our lives on earth are like specs in time, perhaps feeling long to us at points, but nothing compared to time. But our lives here don't end when we close our eyes for the last time. 

I am writing to you acknowledging that you said you understand people write to you about religion out of wanting your souls wellbeing. Your soul is ready for everything good that awaits it, so I feel I must share this with you. I hope it can reach you. 

124,000 prophets came to tell us about one singular truth, that there is one Divine Being and that we are all here being tested, and that in the end, we will be judged. Our Judge is the Merciful, the Loving, the Forgiving, the Pardoner, the Protecting Friend. He is all these things and more. He is the God that forgives, and once we are forgiven, our slates are wiped clean. Robert, the new leaf you have turned in this short time is who you have become, pure and kind and full of light. You are not who you were then, you are who you are now. 

This might be the end of the life of tests and trials and tribulations. But it is not the end of everything. It is the beginning. Existence is infinite. Talk to God, as you have. Pray, pour out what is in you, even if you do so in a whisper or silently. He answers the caller who calls upon Him. 

""I am as My servant thinks I am. I am with him when he mentions Me. 

If he mentions Me to himself, I mention him to Myself;

And if he mentions Me in an assembly, I mention him in an assembly greater than it. 

If he draws near to Me a hand's length, I draw near to Him an arm's length. 

And if he comes to Me walking, I come to him running.""

Walk toward God as you are. He will run to you. He is with you always. 

The last of the prophets to tell us of this essential truth--Who placed us here, why we are here, and what comes after this--his name is Muhammad. 

The messages he conveyed to us were simple. The name of the religion, Islam, is simply submission, which is to God. 

We were all born upon our nature, we were much the same as each other and later took different paths. But the original nature of man is exactly what is asked of us by God. Islam is not a foreign idea, but simply acting upon all that is best for us and our nature and wellbeing, keeping in line with what the Creator knows about His creation that we often don't realize without reminders. 

You are restoring yourself to your nature of peace, kindness, love, light. May you enter an eternity of all of the above and more. 

May you be cleansed of any grief left in you at the gates of heaven, and enter into it knowing it is the home you were heading to all along. 

In heaven, people think back on life as if it were a little thing. Once you are in eternity, everything that has passed must be so tiny, however big they felt then, right?

May we all join you in the eternity of peace and bliss. The best part of heaven isn't golden roads or palaces, it is entering into the peace and tranquility we all seek as human beings, knowingly or unknowingly. 

May you enter into your home with peace, my friend. God bless you. I hope we all see one another at the gates.

,,,,"Hi, Robert. I know I’m very late in responding, so you may never see this, but I wanted to write it anyway. Your post touched me incredibly deeply. I’m just coming out of a rough time in my life mentally, one of many I’ve had, and being stuck inside for months thanks to the pandemic hasn’t helped. But your request for us to live our lives to the fullest - I’m going to strive for that, in every way I can. I’m going to help others around me to do the same. No matter what, we’re all going through this crazy world together, and it should bring us together. 

I texted my mom today, for the first time in a while. Our relationship has never really been all that great, pretty distant. But I’m glad I did, just in case. I hope your dad sees this post. You seem like, through everything, you’ve grown into a strong, kind, wonderful person. You’re even using some of the last of your strength to fulfill a promise you made to a bunch of strangers! That was the first thing that struck me about you. If you ever doubt your strength in these last days, please remember that - through this you’ve inspired so many people to start changing their lives, and there is such beauty and meaning and strength in that.

I don’t know what I believe about an afterlife, but if there is one, I think you’ve earned a place in whatever good side lies ahead. If there’s karma, you’ve just earned a lot, and not in the Reddit sense. And if there isn’t? Your life has had meaning, and you will be remembered. I’ll always remember and look back on this, and remember to LIVE. Even though you’re a complete stranger - I’ll carry this advice with me. I promise this. And I know that’s true of so many others, too.

Know that our thoughts and well-wishes are with you. You have pieces of all of us there with you, the same as you have left with us. Many will be praying for you, like you said out of love and concern and care. The rest of us will be remembering and hoping for peace in this last of your time.

Personally I think death is just like falling asleep. You can't remember the very moment when you fall asleep. I think death is like that. There is literally \*nothing\* to worry about. And they you wake up as a new being. A human, an animal, somewhere, sometime, and the cycle continues. Death is the same as before you were born. Death is interconnected with all life.

I came to r/suboxone about to ask a question, and I stumbled onto this post of yours. I appreciate that you took the time to share yourself so honestly. 

At first I just thought to myself that it was so sweet, insightful, and profound, but then you touched on some things that I’ve struggled with all my life. Maybe part of the reason I turned to heroin to deal with it. I related to your words about having the courage to live life the way you see fit, and not to worry so much about what people think, or the money.

I have always felt the external pressure from parents and everyone that’s mindlessly in the rat race. They accept it as normal, and to them it means they’re doing life right. For whatever reason I don’t view life that way. I’ve endured a lot of frustrations relative to the fact that we all die anyway, and yet we devote our time to make somebody else’s life more comfortable. I didn’t know how to live with that conundrum. Not only are you possibly the first person to relate that same sort of sentiment, but you have the ultimate freedom to dismiss it. 

I loved reading this. It is beautiful, touching, and I think it has a bit of something in it for almost anyone to take from it. I hope I can go out as beautifully and helpfully as you have. Thank you. I wish you the best on your way out, and with whatever may come after. I don’t claim to have knowledge of that either. I don’t believe anyone that says they do. You are proof that you can be optimistic about the things people fear and make up tall tales to cope with. I agree you should never say never, but in the end an all knowing-all loving super-being is going to understand. It’s not like this god individual has made it easy! =)

Your story has connected with me more ways than one so I find myself here leaving a comment for you in your last days with us.

,,,,"Many years ago when my grandfather was on hospice care after a long battle with several types of cancer, I felt his passing. I knew in that exact moment when he left this world which was exactly 4:20am. The very next day as our family sat quietly in his living room looking at pictures and trying to recall memories that we once shared with such a kind and gentle man, we found his tupperware container full of pocket-watches. Among those watches I noticed his favorite one because I've seen him pull it out of his coveralls to carefully open it so many times that it was just burned in memory. I decided to pull his favorite watch out of the container and open it like he once did and was in a bit of shock when I noticed the time. The watch had a bad battery and laid dead on 4:20 which was the time of his passing. I'll never forget this moment. 

We can either let fate lead us through life or we can shape our own destiny.

""Parable of immortality ( A ship leaves . . . ) by Henry (Jackson) Van Dyke - 1852 - 1933

I am standing by the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength, and I stand and watch until at last she hangs like a peck of white cloud just where the sun and sky come down to mingle with each other.

Then someone at my side says, 'There she goes!' Gone where? Gone from my sight - that is all.

She is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side and just as able to bear her load of living freight to the places of destination. Her diminished size is in me, not in her.

And just at the moment when someone at my side says, 'There she goes! ' , there are other eyes watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout : 'Here she comes!'""

You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.”

I don’t smoke, but I’ve been struggling this year... with what feels like everything, and your words have moved me to say something, instead of lurking, which is far more comfortable. Like so many, I haven’t had the easiest life. Between being abused from an early age, bipolar, suicidal, and a workaholic, 2020 has felt like hell.  

And damn, man. I hope you read this, because you’ve helped so many people, including this one pathetic, mess of a human. 

You’ve inspired others to quit smoking just through this thread, and you’ve inspired me to fight for my life. I’m done working seven days a week. I’m done with the self-loathing. I will most definitely stumble on these tenants, but you’re absolutely right. Life is a gift. And so is dreaming, wishing, hoping. Thank you. I don’t know you at all, but you’ve touched my heart.

,,,,"I'm not a regular Reddit user, but I stumbled upon this post and read entire of it slowly, patiently. 
I didn't get close to what you have experienced, but here's a little thing that I would like to share. 
I'm now living as a grown-up teenager with 'subtle pain' that I've been carrying along all the while, for the past few years since I parted with my first love. And I didn't felt like trying another time, not even in the future. I fully regret for the mistake done but, it's unrecoverable. 
However there are words in my mind which resists me from forgetting about her. 
There's one day, that she asked me: what will you do, if you witnessed an accident and unfortunately she's the victim of the accident, lying on the road?
At that time, we weren't together yet as couples. However, without hesitation, I replied: I would give you a kiss… right before you leave. I wanted to ensure that you are leaving in happiness, you are leaving without fears, without regrets. I would make you write the full stop of your life diary, in the best possible manner, with a warm heart, happy smile. 
This might perhaps couldn't relate much to your situation, but I would like to express my sympathy and would like to support you to stay strong and live till the fullest, till the end. I hope that you can, like what I told my past love, that you will be leaving without regrets, leaving with happiness. 
I'm still young, but I'm already sick imagining about how I'm going to move on for the rest of my life with my current regrets that I've brought to myself. 
I wish you all the best, and I really appreciate for this long yet meaningful post. It really made my day. 
I'm believe that your dad will forgive you. Although almost like you, I've done too many mistakes in life that might perhaps even, refrain myself for asking any more forgiveness.

   I want you to know that I'm typing this in the 12th hour of my dismal grave yard shift in middle of the world's most unimportant parking lot as a security guard. I have mad many mistakes and failed many times in my life. I have a girlfriend who loves me very much and I am still trying to love her back despite my brains apparent inability to do so. I lost my job dude to being late to many times and now sit here in this part time weekend only gig to just barely pay my bills. I have been using a vape for the last few months after kicking the habit in January and going back a few months later. I tell you this small window into my life so you might understand me when I say you have given me food for thought and touched my life in a way I didn't think possible. I want you to know I will be doing some thinking in this next week and that its because of you that I will quit smoking and will live every day just a little brighter and with more enthusiasm for the opportunity to try again everyday, until my last day. I don't know you and you don't know me but from the bottom of my heart thank you. I hope you are comfortable and that you pass gracefully and I want you to know if anyone is on the other side you should be greeted with outstretched arms full of love and acceptance. I am nearing the end of my shift and will go home to a warm bed and family made of dear friends.

I am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze, and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength, and I stand and watch her until she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come down to meet and mingle with each other. Then someone at my side says: “ There! She's gone!” Gone where? Gone from my slght—that is all. She is just as large in mast and bull and spar as she was when she left my side, and just as able to hear her load of living freight to the place of her destination. Her diminished size is in me. and not in her.

And just at that moment when someone at my side says: "" There! She's gone!” there are other eyes that are watching for her coming; and other voices ready to take up the glad shout: “There she comes!""

I go back and forth in what I believe but I really, dearly like to hope that prayer can connect us all to each other in some way that can’t be explained. Tonight, I hope so much that God is as real as I feel he is and that he can be with you when you need him. I hope that your letters get out in time but if they don’t, I hope that you still feel forgiven. I think all these people reaching out to you, regardless of your past or anything you might have done should show you that there is goodness and beauty left in this world and that forgiveness ultimately wins. Although I never knew you, I did love someone deeply who struggled with alcohol addiction and we went through a lot because of it. I know it’s not the same as hearing it from your own loved one but having been in the role of the person being “wronged,” I forgive you. And I forgave him too, a long time ago even if I no longer wanted to speak with him. It’s possible it might be the same for your loved ones too. 

As for the rest of your words, man did the ones about work and overtime hit hard. I have some changes to make and some boundaries to set. I let my job as a teacher become my whole identity and I want you to know I believe in what you have to say and that I’m going to follow your advice. I typically work all Sunday every Sunday. In your honor, I’m going to sleep in, visit with my parents and pets back home, make sure my boyfriend knows how much I still love him despite the arguing we keep getting into lately, text my grandparents, and let the day unfold naturally without any schedule. When I find a moment that is peaceful and beautiful, I will be thinking of you and pray over you in that moment. Thank you for writing what you did, it impacted me.

You have lived to the best of your abilities. You look back now with perfect hindsight so you see the hours lost. Those hours you spent working were still living. You might have inadvertently made someone's life better in a way you never knew.

 The places you missed traveling to in real life are still there. If you are strong enough, spend 15 minutes visiting each online. I'm sure someone would set you up with VR on short notice.

Use your last moments of life not looking back but forward. As for your father's forgiveness, know that as long as you truly hold that feeling of sorrow you had for the wrongs you've committed, all is forgiven. It's the fact that you know what you did and are honestly trying to make amends for no personal gain. That's all a father ever wants from his child. 

Reading this post has made me step back from my little world. Reevaluated my situation as I have been contemplating the problems I've created lately. You've touched my heart with your words and I think it's time for me to press forward. Life can feel long and lonely sometimes but it's actually quite short but full of souls.

I'm sitting at my computer finding I have trouble formulating my thoughts so I hope this doesn't turn into a comment of nonsensical stream of consciousness. I wanted to genuinely express to you that your post moved me and has evoked many emotions. I have saved your post and intend to revisit it many times in the future. I'm a natural worrier and procrastinator and your perspective is invaluable to really showing me and I'm sure people like me, the real scope of the mountainous molehills we create for ourselves. Living for the now and dealing with problems in the moment is something I do and will continue to struggle with for a long time. Your perspective and words of wisdom will no doubt ring in my head for years to come and I hope, might help me gain a better philosophy for life. While there are no doubt many more poignant messages here than mine I wanted to make sure I added my voice to the many that are here to see you off, we're here for as long as you need. I wish you peace and tranquility. You will not be forgotten. You and the words you've given us will remain.

I obviously don't know you but what you said spoke deeply to me and I feel an incredible sense of sympathy for you. You're so eloquent and seem good-hearted. It strikes me as odd that you have no one around you, at least in person, to be by your side. I guess life is indifferent that way and I'm sorry for that.

You have rekindled the urgency for my pursuit of life. I too want to write a novel. I'm making slow progress and should probably move faster. Our time may be cut short and in any case is finite. It is so easy to lose track of how precious every day is when you're lost in the apparent monotony. Thank you for reminding me of the importance and urgency of living your dreams, so incisively.

I'm not sure what to say to you. I feel an immense urge to make you feel alright, to convey a warmth, but I don't know how.

I think that regardless of who you were in the past, you are a good dude now. You were dealt a bad hand, and are taking it in stride, which is all one can do (I am a big subscriber to stoicism).

Robert I will remember you. I will probably think back to this post of yours at certain key junctures in my life. Thank you. If consciousness does endure, then it is probably infinite — that has been my great fear ever since psychedelics took me somewhere deep and dark. If that is the case, I hope it is mostly pleasant.

Having read his words, I am truly and deeply touched by his (or Robert, your, if you’re reading this) openness, insights, and raw wisdom. 
Here’s what I’d like to have happen, but I’m not sure how to get it done...I’d like to have Morgan Freeman record a reading of this post.  Before you laugh, hear me out...I know we all love to hear Mr Freeman read things (I’d listen to him read the ingredients on a bag of Cheetos) but as I was reading this post, that’s the kind of voice I heard it in.  And I’d like to see this post immortalized somehow.  
So how could we get this done?  Kickstarter?

Once heard someone quote ""if you cannot explain something simply, you don't know it well enough"". Hearing that changed how I approached education for ever. It has guided my studies ever since and will be something I pass down to my family when I eventually have them. 

Your words left such an impact on me. I wish to live a life of purpose. To leave something behind once my time comes. Reading your words helps to keep me on that quest. When I think about what I want out of life I reflect on this. I know you have passed but you have stayed with me ever since I first read this.

,,,,"I wish my mother had stopped smoking. I remember her trying many times over the past thirty years but every time something stressful came along or she felt like she needed something for her hands to do, out came the smokes. “I’ll really quit next time” she’d say. 

She never got lung cancer or anything but her weakened lungs were very likely a factor in her developing pneumonia for which she was prescribed a horribly dangerous antibiotic. It was only a 5 day cycle but she developed hallucinations the first day. And they got stronger each day to the point that she couldn’t sleep but she tried to push through the five days. Another side effect of the drug she was on (Levofloxacin) is suicidal ideation. Which wasn’t great for her considering her past with depression but she’d always been very anti suicide after losing her youngest brother to suicide. But on the last day of her 5 day cycle, she walked out into the yard, fed her dogs, and hanged herself from the chain of a swing set. I later found out that hundreds of people with no history of suicidal ideation or attempts had killed them selves while on the same antibiotic and that the manufacturer had decided to stop manufacturing it because despite how dangerous it was, doctors were overprescribing it.

3 Nuns are driving a car on their way to Sunday mass when they get in a fatal car accident.  As they open their eyes they see themselves standing before the Pearly Gates in the presence of Saint Peter.

“Welcome, Sisters, to the Kingdom of Heaven,” Peter says, “please get in line,” gesturing to the slowly moving line of souls passing through the Gates.

As the first nun approaches the front of the line, Peters smiles at her and says “you have led a holy life of course, but to pass through this Gate you must be free of sin. I will give you the chance to confess any secret sins you carry now.”

The first nun thinks for a moment and then says to Peter in a timid and quiet voice; “once when I was young a boy asked me to touch his penis, and I did, but I only used one finger.”

“It is good that you told me sister, to be forgiven for this sin, you must dip the offending finger in this pool of holy water and say 5 Our Fathers and 5 Hail Marys.”

As the first nun dips her finger and says her prayers, Saint Peter notices the two nuns behind her have begun to jostle for position in line.

“Sisters! Sisters! What is the meaning of this? You cannot fight in the shadow of the Pearly Gates, the very house of God!” Peter exclaims.

“Sorry Saint Peter, but if I’m going to have to gargle that holy water, it sure as heck isn’t going to be after Sister Mary here sticks her bottom

,,,,"I'm 35 years old, a mom and I have a neurological disease that has me mostly housebound, in sharp contrast to the live I was living before.

I keep reminding myself of everything I can't do, because I have to pace myself so that I don't get worse.

You can do it. I just recently had xrays by a radiation tech that had significant physical disabilities.

I have a hard time reading and writing, which used to be one of my great lives, because of cognitive issues from being sick.

I just picked up the violin last week and decided to start learning.

I'm learning to carve and turn wood, too.

I'm limited, but I'm not finished.

Since I've been sick, I have met so many doctors that should have never gone into the field.

Having a doctor that understood chronic illness would feel like I didn't have to speak, because you would know.

All the countless hours of explaining and advocating and defending symptoms, all gone.

We NEED doctors like you so badly.

I wish you all of the luck.

And if you get that picture I would love to see that painting.

If I ever get to the stage of the violin where it sounds like music and not screaming cats, I think I would like to compose something for Robert.

I think many of us are going to be inspired by his words to create.

If you wanted to paint the photo she posted of Robert, it is in the most recent post on his profile. And I think you should read the post, as his nurse also said some things he told her to say before he passed, as well. 

Anyways, I also have chronic health issues that have been flaring up a LOT the last few months due to immense stress (COVID/politics, but also my mother passing away at the end of June amid all the other stress...) and I have also been feeling the way you have.

,,,,"Would you have a moment to chat, friend? 💙 Like you, I'm an undergraduate student. I put my education on hold 2 years ago due to overwhelming personal and mental health issues. I have felt nothing but guilt and remorse over that decision since then. I have felt lost without school to focus on. I always did well academically and I genuinely enjoyed my classes, but I started to feel pressure from the difficulty of the subjects. I started to doubt my choice of major and question my plans for my future, and my anxiety worsened all of it.

I've felt like I have been drifting from each day to the next, waking up with no goals or aspirations. I've gotten by each day just entertaining myself, occasionally doing productive projects around the house or working online, but overall not moving forward in life. I still can't drive and can't afford a car.

I haven't worked a real job apart from summer work that had employed me for a couple of months. I've made most of my income through online employment. The most progress I made recently was signing up for a winter job for shoveling which while small, I am proud of myself for doing it.

I'm paralyzed by my anxiety and depression. It has held me back in every area of my adult life. I am stunted socially/financially, don't have friends, don't go out, don't have connections. My family life has suffered as well, and my family has become hard to get along with due to my situation and them not understanding it.

This post touched my heart and made me feel a deep sadness and existential realization I have not felt in a very long time. Life is truly short and our time on this Earth to do what we please is not guaranteed. This post awakened something in me, a desperate need to change and make something of my life and not throw it away, including repairing my relationships with loved ones which have become badly damaged.

What you said about time really hit me. Thank you.

It seems as though you are at peace with your current situation and for that I am glad. I am agnostic so I dont hold myself to an ideology or religion but I think in your situation I would still be curious and not rule anything out.

I hope you get to soar, I hope you get to fly through the universe and leave this world behind. I hope you can see what all of this means and find out all the secrets of life across the infinite. 

Wherever you go after death in the hours to come, you touched some lives here Robert. 

Now I will go to work (on a Sunday), and I'll be thinking about you. I'll be thinking about your wise advice and how this will be the last time I work on a Sunday, the day I read about a man that was about to die of lung cancer and wished he had of used his time better at stages in his life. Because time is all we have. Time is our friend and enemy. Time is our product that is constantly up for auction to the highest bidder and of time we have little to sell, making it all the more precious. 

I wish you nothing but peace in your next journey (or rest), if that is what it shall be.... Thank you.

I highly recommend watching TwoSet Violin https://youtu.be/pE9aZs1MM64 and joining us at r/lingling40hrs. They are hilarious and the sub is a lot of fun with memes, etc. Definitely compose your piece and post it there when you're ready! Also watch Ray Chen https://youtu.be/cm2tkDtXNJ0 - he was doing a lot of livestreams a few months ago. He's a elite professional violinist and I love that he's made himself so accessible to his fans.

,,,,"To anyone terrified of facing life without another cigarette or if not able top quit, to be taken from this life too soon like this man Robert, I offer you one piece of advice, after years and years of trying to quit smoking and failing, a friend of mine asked me if i wanted this electronic cig vape thing, which i thought ""ah what the hell, might as well give it a whirl"".. Well i tried it, never had a cigarette since. That was 5years ago.  I know that there is still nicotine in the juice. But i would argue that nicotine isnt the part that gives you cancer from smoking. Besides this, you can taper down in the juice that you buy, they sell e-juice, with lottsa nictotine, all the way down to no nicotine and just juice, and it all ""steams"" the same.. You see, the vape, is just steamed water, with nicotine in it. Thats why you can vape indoors, or anywhere for that matter and it doesnt smell, it instantly disappears because its just steam.. 

Look, dont take my word for it, do some research.. Keep in mind the people that were getting sick from lung probelms a while back, were buying black market juice cut with THC, and more importantly Vitamin E.  Thats what was causing the lungs to fill with fluid apparently.

Anyhoo, i just noticed a bunch of people saying were throwing their cigarettes, its one thing to throw away a pack, but thats not the hard part.. The hard part comes when you can an argument with your significant other, or go tot the bar for some drinks, (the beauty of this is that it actually allows you to keep the ""physical habit"" part) where you  are actually  ""smoking"" something..

If you work in an industry where you can only take a break if you actually smoke, like in a kitchen or restaurant, well, you can still go smoke with the dishwashers, except they will be like ""ques es estos cigaro wey"" lol 

i dunno. Im using a Jul now, which can be charged on your computer as it is no bigger than elongated USB. But there are all sortsa of shapes and sizes..

Anyway this is coming from somebody who wore three nicotine patches, chewed nicotine gum compulsively, and still smoked cigarettes on top of that , so if i can quit, so can you. i just needed some help, and e-cigs, or ""vaping"" is now a viable way to do that. 

I mean look a it like back in the day before they had viagra.. If you had issues, whelp, you just fucking had to suffer. Now you dont. Same with quitting smoking. You dont need to suffer,  and you can stop giving those fucking companies their blood money.

One last thing, while its true that more research needs to be done regarding what the rapid heating of vegetable oil, sugar and water does to its chemistry prior to inhalation into the lungs, using your own common sense, you can tell right away its a magnitude less toxic than ""smoke"". 

I used to have dry cough while i slept, that each ex-wife used to complain about. Well ,my girlfriend has never heard me even cough!! lol

,,,,Yes yes.  Dco it at your own pace. That is the most important part imo. I know some dr's put you on that shit and then they think they know when is best to start giving you less and causing mad setbacks. I was clean for 6 years but are those Years clean if you're using subs everyday? Idk it's a weird thing. Finally I just tapered off 1mg every month. At the end it gets super psychological.  You don't need 1mg a day to function but your brain demands it.  The last part was the hardest. You can do it as long as you want it! But your doing just fine now doing a controlled amount a day. As long as you aren't chasing a high with it you'll be ok. After the second year I stopped thinking about opiates completely. The thought of trying to get  some now absolutely disgusts me because past me that I finally saw for who she had become disgusts me. I've been around pills and h and no bone in my body was whispering *just do one! You got a sub script anyway* that mentality is so far gone thank God.  This post is a real eye opener. A true addict letter. I hope people truly heard his words as they're saying cos this is so valuable. I wish someone would have said all this to young me. This is stuff they should be showing to high schoolers. Not stupid videos that say weed kills and leads everyone to drug addictions. If I heard real people's stories in high school I think I would have been more cautious. Who knows though. I read this 4 times and cried 4 times. Such a shame when someone turns their life around but its too late to live and enjoy things you missed earlier cos of addiction. A true tragedy because everyone deserves a happy life in the end.

- Thought that vaping was a good way to quit; but I was wrong, I vaped a lot more than I smoked. The only good thing that came out of that was that I didn’t smell like an ashtray anymore. But then it got bad, really bad, I started having trouble breathing because of the vape, up until a point when I woke up gasping for air. This was one year in but at that point I was scared shitless and threw the vape away, never touched it again. Decided that there is not enough data/research on it and didn’t want to be a test subject any longer.
- That’s when I picked cigarettes back up. Breathing improved but I was feeling miserable. (you don’t actually realise how miserable you are/feel until you quit for at least a week or two when your smell, taste, and stamina start to improve).
- I picked up gum and mints since March (2mg mints and 4mg gum). The ones that did the job for me were the fruity Nicorette mints and flavoured gum - the original ones taste horrible.
- I also tried the patch and the spray but those didn’t work. Not only that I needed the nicotine, but also needed something to replace the act of smoking.

- Most of the information that you find online is true, although it sounds like someone is trying hard to convince you to quit. First few days are difficult, smell improves, taste improves, etc etc, they’re true.
- Depending on your personality, it might take a lot of power of will to do it. Find a reason to do it, find someone to do it for, be scared of the consequences that it could have on your last breaths.
- If you are to take nicotine gum / mints, be ready for a wild ride; it will take you a while to get your nicotine intake right. Sometimes it might be too much or too little, but don’t give up, work on that, it only takes few days. If you really want to do the math, even better, it can be instant.

The best part is that after about a month or so, you won’t want a cigarette anymore. You will want nicotine and will need to decrease your intake slowly, but you won’t “fancy” a cigarette any longer. The smell, taste, and feeling will put you off.

This is my experience, but then again, what worked for me, might not work for you. All I can say is that I tried a lot of things to find something that actually worked.

Just remind yourself that someone cares about you, that you are not weak, that you don’t want to suffer, and that the craving is only temporary. Be as stubborn as you ever was.

Most important!! Set a rule to not touch a cigarette no matter what. Seriously, I can’t stress how important this is - don’t. If you think that “one’s ok” for whatever reason you’ll try to trick yourself into, you’ve failed and have to start the process again.

Oh.. and the best part about this is that you’ll save a ton of money. While a pack here in the UK costs about £10, 105 nicotine gums cost about £13 on Amazon and last you a lot longer.

Update on Robbie from Cherri,6631.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/jv773f/update_on_robbie_from_cherri/,"Good morning. My name is Cherri. I was Robbie's volunteer doula with the hospice program. I am posting here to honor his wishes in providing this message board with an update after his passing. I am not familiar with this app, but Robbie gave me a little tutorial. Please forgive any mistakes :) Robbie had initially wanted to pass while conscious, however, he was having increased difficulty breathing Sunday morning. He received last rites from our chaplain and was sedated with midazolam, at his request, at 3:05 pm. He remained asleep and appeared comfortable. Agonal respirations were noted by the nurse at 6:14 pm and suppressed with morphine. The physician called time of death at 6:27 pm, Sunday, November 15, 2020. Robbie's passing was peaceful and without pain. Robbie spoke often of the kind messages he received on this board. I know they brought him comfort. His final posting was incredibly poignant and moved even our most seasoned staff to tears. He was a quiet man. I think his voice was his words. It was honor to attend to him in his passing. I was attracted to hospice because not everybody breaks a bone, not everybody has heart disease, but everybody dies. It is an honor to be with others as the undergo this universal journey, and it was a particular honor to attend to Robbie, who had no family or friends by his side. I am providing some images on imager that Robbie wanted shared with this board, one of him young and healthy, the other a final handwritten note. Please let me know if the link works:

 http://imgur.com/a/OLbDMdx

I obviously cannot hold onto his phone :) it will be shut off and filed away with his estate, which is being handled by his family, who our social workers were able to locate Sunday evening. They expressed regret at the news of his illness and passing. We are sharing his final posting with them as well. One last thing before I go. First, Robby expressed many concerns about his suboxone. As the opiate epidemic continues to ravage our communities, we see more and more patients entering hospice on suboxone and methadone. I want those of you with opioid maintenance to know that you will never be judged by our staff, and your medications are not a barrier for care. Our organization consults with a pain specialist physician specifically for these cases. We will never let you die in pain. Never! I hope this posting provides some closure for those of you who have been following Robbie's case. These fast cancers are always sad, but Robbie faced his passing with dignity and grace. He was truly a wonderful man, and he lives on in our memories. With regards, Cherri N ",,,[]

,,,,"I read Robbie's post late Saturday night.  I thought about his words all through the night, and into Sunday.  My grandfather, before he died, said something similar to me.  ""The only thing you can never get back is time.""

I've put off a lot of things because of time.  And fear.

Yesterday evening, about an hour before the local Microcenter closed, I drove out and bought a brand new Wacom tablet.  A good one.  I've always wanted to be an artist, and my drawing skills are... well, let's just say they need a lot of improvement.  Getting a tablet is something I've wanted to do for a long time, and I know it's not some magical tool.  It's just something I can use to work with the programs I want to work with.

I bought that hardware because of Robbie's post.  I told the guy at the checkout counter about his post, too.  I just had to share it.  I responded to Robbie's post on Saturday, and his edit to his original was yesterday at 2:30... I have no idea if he read what I wrote, but that's not important.  He was all of a few hours dead when I went to buy the tablet.

I'm just one person that Robbie touched.  There are so very many more.  This is my way of remembering him, of honoring his memory.  He said to follow our dreams, to not waste whatever time we have... so, I am doing just that.

After nearly 40 years, I'm going to become a digital artist.  I'm going to put in the suck-time, until I suck slightly less.

,,,,"I started writing a comment on Robbie’s last post and never quite got through it, so I figured I’d finish it now. 

My dad died 2 years ago. I was 23, and he never got to enjoy his retirement. He was sick for as long as I can remember  from heart disease that was some part genetic but largely due to smoking his entire life. My dad was already in his 40s when I was born, but I never knew him as anything other than ill. He didn’t quit smoking until his 3rd heart attack. I’m so very touched by Robert using his last message to encourage more people to quit smoking. I understand how hard an addiction it is to quit, but it is very dear to my heart that he championed that cause literally on his death bed. 

My dad had been on some forms of palliative care and hospice for a couple of years before he died, since he had been on life support and almost passed away at one point before. I helped the best I was able to with all of those things at that time, appointments, cleaning, medicine, someone to talk to, whatever I could do. When the time ultimately came that my dad did pass, he had entered the hospital shortly before and they sent him off to a nursing facility. It was far, the first one that had a bed, and my family was not financial well off. Our only working car had recently broken down so we were relying on rides. All of this to say, my dad was alone when he passed. We saw him as much as we could but when the moment that mattered came, he was alone. Except for the care staff at the facility he was in. This was a man who was loved beyond belief with a caring family and yet he was still alone when he died. 

Since then, I’ve moved states and made a lot of changes and while I always wanted to work in the medical field, I never quite felt like I could do it. My dad being alone when he died, and the guilt I feel from that, has really pushed me to make changes. I’ve since stated working as a nursing assistant at a care facility for those with dementia and other illnesses. I decided that I would do for other people what those who worked at my dad’s facility did for him. In the year I’ve worked at the facility, I’ve held a lot of people’s hands as they died or in the days and hours before the ultimately pass. There is no greater honour than being someone’s comfort in their transition. Thank you for the work you so, Cherri. I’m so happy you were able to give Robert that comfort that he deserved, that we all deserve regardless of our circumstances, regardless of addictions or past choices. I’m so happy that even though Robbie had no family around, he was not alone. And I’m sure he was very loved by someone somewhere even though no one was there at those last moments beside his hospice team. 

All of the nurses, doctors, CNAs, hospice workers, you’re all heros with such a hard job. With all of the caregiver burnout and long shifts and hard days, it can be hard to see through that fog but maybe people like Robert can help us remember why it’s worth it.

I read his last post again, bringing me into tears again. Lucky me I checked his profile and saw this update by Cherri. 
I'm sure I'm not the only one that has cried after reading all of these words. I'm surprised how we can feel such pain, empathy and sadness for a stranger that we never met in person, only his words...
Robert, wherever you are, just want to tell you I greatly appreciate your words, your knowledge and your lessons. 
You moved me and many others deeply, and you have influenced (even if it's a tiny bit) ourselves, to see life with better eyes, even if it's only for today.

I just wished that people like you, wouldn't have to go through this moment alone. Many of us would be gladly willing to sit next to you, and if not in person online, through a videocall or a normal call. 
Human connection doesn't require of months of years of bonding, it sometimes happens in the most unexpected times.

I wish you well, I don't believe in life after death, but it makes me feel better imagining you are at the other side of the screen, so you can read all of our words.

I hate my husband and i’m cold and I keep wanting to walk to my back porch except there’s no pack and no lighter and no ashtray.  I have a tiny vape that is too small for me to break in my fist and a backup in case this one gets lost/dropped/thrown at my husbands head because he won’t do the fucking dishes.

My allergies are 50% better, and I am snide about it because there’s no way that one day without cigarettes did that.  

My skin is dry and my video game is annoying, and I bet by tomorrow I’ll hate way more stuff than I do right now.

....that’s all i got, now i need to go buy moisturizer that will doubtless make me colder and might cause a divorce.

**UPDATE:**

Hour 51.
Have not thrown vape yet.   Still cold, still want to walk out back and draw on something that isn’t there.  Reminded husband that he has literally not cleaned a toilet in 3 years and that I can’t paint because he spies on me.  

No coughing yet, and that’s annoying because at least then I’d feel like i was accomplishing something.  My allergies are still better.  I’m still cold. I’m still tired.   I can’t think of anything fun to do.

My contractor asked for $60,000 by the end of the week and I don’t even care because I’m thirsty.  

Smoking is like going on a ski trip where there are no lifts to get you to the top of the mountain.  The cost of doing it is that you have to drudge yourself, miserable and bored (*so fucking bored**) and uncomfortable, back to where you started. Uphill. In bad shoes.

,,,,"This is a message for everyone here who really wants to quit and for Robbie. Maybe even a little case study - looking back at how I quit. I am not the best writer but I will try to summarise my experience:

- Smoker for 10 years, switched to vaping for one year, and then moved onto mints and nicotine gum.
- Thought that vaping was a good way to quit; but I was wrong, I vaped a lot more than I smoked. The only good thing that came out of that was that I didn’t smell like an ashtray anymore. But then it got bad, really bad, I started having trouble breathing because of the vape, up until a point when I woke up gasping for air. This was one year in but at that point I was scared shitless and threw the vape away, never touched it again. Decided that there is not enough data/research on it and didn’t want to be a test subject any longer.
- That’s when I picked cigarettes back up. Breathing improved but I was feeling miserable. (you don’t actually realise how miserable you are/feel until you quit for at least a week or two when your smell, taste, and stamina start to improve).
- I picked up gum and mints since March (2mg mints and 4mg gum). The ones that did the job for me were the fruity Nicorette mints and flavoured gum - the original ones taste horrible.
- I also tried the patch and the spray but those didn’t work. Not only that I needed the nicotine, but also needed something to replace the act of smoking.

- Most of the information that you find online is true, although it sounds like someone is trying hard to convince you to quit. First few days are difficult, smell improves, taste improves, etc etc, they’re true.
- Depending on your personality, it might take a lot of power of will to do it. Find a reason to do it, find someone to do it for, be scared of the consequences that it could have on your last breaths.
- If you are to take nicotine gum / mints, be ready for a wild ride; it will take you a while to get your nicotine intake right. Sometimes it might be too much or too little, but don’t give up, work on that, it only takes few days. If you really want to do the math, even better, it can be instant.

The best part is that after about a month or so, you won’t want a cigarette anymore. You will want nicotine and will need to decrease your intake slowly, but you won’t “fancy” a cigarette any longer. The smell, taste, and feeling will put you off.

This is my experience, but then again, what worked for me, might not work for you. All I can say is that I tried a lot of things to find something that actually worked.

Just remind yourself that someone cares about you, that you are not weak, that you don’t want to suffer, and that the craving is only temporary. Be as stubborn as you ever was.

Most important!! Set a rule to not touch a cigarette no matter what. Seriously, I can’t stress how important this is - don’t. If you think that “one’s ok” for whatever reason you’ll try to trick yourself into, you’ve failed and have to start the process again.

Oh.. and the best part about this is that you’ll save a ton of money. While a pack here in the UK costs about £10, 105 nicotine gums cost about £13 on Amazon and last you a lot longer.

I’m babysitting my sister and she thinks she needs to go to the ER for her period and idk,5926.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1eyzp4t/im_babysitting_my_sister_and_she_thinks_she_needs/,"
Okay so I (19M) am babysitting my little sister (15F) while our parents are on a trip internationally. It’s like a completely different time zone and the signal sucks, they get home in like 6 days. But we are both pretty self sufficient and felt like it would be fine and my parents left us food and money and stuff. We’ve been Gucci for a whole week so far. 
Anyway this morning she got her period while we were just like sitting playing video games and she got blood all over the couch so I paused the game while she took care of it and put on a tampad and didn’t make a big deal of it. I was trying to be nice because I know it can make girls cranky and it hurts and stuff, so I got snacks and a blanket and whatever and we kept playing. Well like maybe 40 minutes later she freaked out because she bled on the couch again and I’m like did you put the thing on wrong or what? So she changed again and I even helped her clean the blood off the couch this time and I figured she’d use a bigger feminine thing. Nbd. Well like 30 minutes after we start playing again she pauses and goes to the bathroom and I hear her scream so I run over there thinking there’s a spider or something but she came out holding like this…chunk. It was like a chunk of blood. But looking at it I’m like shit maybe that’s an organ? Like is that your kidney? But she was like no it’s a clot. And she was freaking out about it. Which yeah it was gross. It was like the size of a hacky sack. So I’m like okay well go flush your clot. Anyway she cleans herself up but then she said she doesn’t want to play anymore and I’m like ok. So she spent an hour on the couch with her face all scrunched up doing yoga breathing and telling me her cramps were the worst ever, so I gave her Tylenol but she wouldn’t take it because she said she feels like she’s gonna throw up. I brought her water and juice and warmed up that gel thing you stick on your stomach you know? So I was trying to help. Well then she says “oh no” and she gets up and goes to the bathroom and as she’s walking she’s got like blood going down her leg. She yelled for me from the bathroom and I go in there and she’s sitting there and I hear this plopping sound and there’s more of those chunks. Like maybe 2 of them? And she says “I think we need to go to the ER”. I’m like why? And she tells me this is more blood than she’s ever had and she doesn’t feel good. But periods are supposed to suck right? And she wouldn’t take the Tylenol either so she didn’t really try to manage it at home. So then she started yelling at me telling me I have to take her because she can’t drive but I’m pretty sure our parents will kill me if I take her to the ER for her period? Is that a thing? She’s sitting in the shower now because she said she thought the warm water would feel good and she was sick of bleeding on stuff and it’s more comfortable than the toilet. I asked her if she just needs a bigger tampad and she told me to stfu so she’s not even communicating with me at this point. I’ve asked her a few times if she’s okay in there and she tells me “I’m bleeding out Mason what do you think?” So like she’s not unconscious. 
Idk, I don’t know anything about this but I also know she hates blood and flips out about any minor cut too. Is going to the ER because of a period a thing? Can you bleed too much? I thought there was only a certain amount of blood in the vagina every month. I feel like she’d be more comfortable at home anyway if she’d just take the Tylenol. Idk what to do. My sister is like average teenage girl height, pretty skinny because shes a ballerina and doesn’t eat meat. She takes accutain for her pimples. I’m not sure if there’s other stuff that’s important? She’s had her period for like a year now I’m pretty sure? Maybe more. She takes flintstone gummy vitamins sometimes, like the ones in the purple jar. And she’s obsessed with Celsius energy drinks. She wears contacts and she had her wisdom teeth removed two months ago. 

Idk I want her to be okay and stuff but I’m not sure the ER is a good choice? Help?

Update: 
Alright so I guess I was posting updates in the comments but it’s better here? Anyway so. 
My sister is okay. She had some scans that were all fine and they don’t think she has fiberoids or tumors or anything like that. She’s feeling a little better but still staying here at least another day. Our mom and dad are flying home tomorrow now. My mom was pissed I texted her instead of calling at first lol. 

Already had someone try to find me on insta so like if you know me or her no you don’t lol. She doesn’t want this going around school or whatever so don’t dox us for at least 3 years lol. Shes cool with me updating though without her name or whatever. 

Also our parents don’t know about this either idk I feel like we should wait until it’s been a few years to tell them too so they don’t kill me lol. She’s gonna hold this shit over my head forever lol. 
Anyway they think she has a blood disorder that makes her not clot right. I’m not 100% sure how it works because she had big clots? But they said they’re pretty sure that’s what’s going on because her PTT took longer than normal to clot. They’re waiting on von wildabrand (sp?) testing to come back but they think she has type 2 probably. Gonna Google that tonight bc idk what that is and I’ve never heard of it so I guess if any of the doctors know what that is or if this sounds like it lmk. 

Yeah wasn’t expecting this to blow up like this lol. I thought this was just like doctors answering questions like a help line. But my sister said thank you for everyone telling me to take her and she’s okay. 


Update again: 
They confirmed it’s Von Willdebrans (idk if I’ll ever spell that right) anyway it’s genetic I guess so they want me to get tested too but like obviously I’ve never had periods and I’ve never had surgery so it wouldn’t be as obvious. There’s still more testing ig, like more specific to the type. But anyway- sister is good and we have an answer. She’s gonna talk to a hematologist next week about what that means and stuff. 

New update: 
So ig I also have Von Willebrands. So does our mom. Ive always bruised a lot and got super bad nose bleeds but like I was also a dumbass kid/teen who thought life was an audition for Jackass so I didn’t think it was weird lol. Anyway we’re all about to be real familiar with hematology and my mom is pissed she’s been told some women just bleed more her whole life lol. Guess my mom and sister weren’t just exaggerating when they would say they were bleeding out. So yeah ig if you’re a girl reading this and you bleed as much as my sister you should see a doctor. Hopefully no one gets gaslit like my mom did but yeah. Here’s a public apology for being ignorant on what yall actually go through bc I thought you could only bleed so much a month 💀 fully willing to admit how fucking stupid that was lol. ",,,[]

For heavy menstrual bleeding - NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (advil) can actually help reduce bleeding and might be able to help while also reducing the pain somewhat. 

If she’s sexually active there is a chance this something else though, such as a miscarriage. I’ll have the ER ask her this as this is none of my business since I am not the doctor taking care of her. That being said don’t be blindsided if the ER asks her questions about her sexual health.

(NAD.) The abdominal CT is a much better (more detailed) image than the ultrasound and it will cover a bigger area. The ultrasound was probably pelvic (taken from outside) or vaginal (taken from inside), so it's looking at the uterus, tubes and ovaries for things that may have caused heavy bleeding - like a cyst in the ovary that ruptured (basically, a big fluid-y bubble that can burst ). Since it sounds like they didn't find any of the usual suspects via ultrasound, they're going to look at the abdominal cavity (the ""stomach area"", but it's filled with a LOT: stomach, intestines, liver, etc) for less-usual suspects. Sometimes, women can get tissue that travels outside of the uterus, but still tries to shed monthly - it can be painful and cause really heavy bleeding (it's called endometriosis). So that might be something they're looking for. If there are things that they're explaining to you or tests/meds they're telling you about, don't hesitate to just say - ""Could you explain that to me? I've never heard of it before and I want to pass on the right info to our parents."" You might feel more comfortable asking one of the nurses your sister is entertaining so well. ;)

Honestly dude, bleeding too much can be a sign of a variety of symptoms that can be serious or not. I really just hope it’s a really bad period, but who knows.

In my late 30’s I was finally diagnosed with fibroids and it was because in my early 30’s I had my first period just like this. It took over 5 years to finally be taken seriously and it investigated properly.

Periods happen, but abnormal periods are rarer. As much as you don’t want to overreact, under-reacting can be much worse. 

TBF, I also chuckled reading ‘tampad’, but I know you’re a 19YO male. I don’t expect you to be well versed in OB/GYN things. 

Your parents should understand that this was a good call to bring her to the hospital.

,,,,"Thank you for mentioning this! I immediately thought that this sounds like a miscarriage. Severe cramps combined with this amount of bleeding screams miscarriage to me. Of course there can be other causes, but end of the day she 100% needs to be seen. OP it’s understandable you don’t have a lot of experience with periods and don’t know what to do, so please listen to the person who does have some experience with periods. They are the ones who can tell you if something is abnormal for them or not. Even if she “freaks out” about blood regularly, I highly doubt your sister wants to go sit in the ER for hours bleeding instead of staying at home playing video games with you or comfortable in her own bed. If she says she needs to go to the ER, she most likely does. 

Good on you for helping your sister though, you’re clearly trying to take the best care of her you can. For future reference, if you’re unsure if something is a medical emergency or not, you could try looking up if her regular doctor has an after-hours number for urgent matters, they might be able to answer questions for you.

I would go to urgent care/ er if I started feeling lightheaded, if the clots were bigger than my closed fist, if I was bleeding through more than 2 heavy day pads in less than an hour, if I had any reason to suspect a miscarriage. Also tampons are the ones that go inside you like a plug. A pad is an absorbant sticky thing that you stick on your undies. Most women typically only lose a couple teaspoons or tablespoons of blood a month but you can lose more if there is an issue and it can at times be dangerous. I'd say if she feels like this is an urgent enough issue to warrant waiting for hours in the er then she may need to go.  Worst case if you go is, its just a heavier than normal period and we all overreacted. Worst case if you don't go is that she could be losing dangerous amounts of blood.

,,,,"Just like the other poster said, directed donations from family aren't typically recommended due to GVHD risk even though leukoreduction filtration is standard now when processing blood product donations and irradiation of the product can remove the residual WBCs. The only time we really do directed donations from family members is when the patient has an antibody to a high frequency antigen or has a very rare blood type, like Bombay or Rh null, that a family member is significantly more likely to have the same phenotype as the patient than a random donor. 

Also, unlike what Hollywood loves to portray for the drama, blood donations can't go directly from donor to patient. Processing and testing donations for infectious diseases usually takes roughly 48 hours. It'd be significantly faster for them to transfuse B-, O+, or O- random donor blood instead or just order more B+ from their supplier than it would be to specifically collect from her brother unless they live in such a remote area that blood has to be flown in.

Like please reread this and hear yourself. She's freaking out, it's not her first period, she's bleeding enough it's soaking near everything and there's clumps and your first thought is ""this doesn't seem like a big deal it's supposed to suck."" That's not a good response or approach and if you hadn't come to reddit to get it confirmed she may have had more risks or something awful happen. 

Good for deciding to take her now but if you had or ever get a girlfriend if you swing that way *please* just listen to women on this stuff. If you've never had it happen personally you don't know and don't have the knowledge or good thought to make the call on if what a woman is saying is an er trip or not. 

Also it would be good measure to apologize to your sister for dismissing and downplaying her concerns. She knows her body best and you should've listened without reddit involvement. If your parent have money for an international trip and to leave you two alone they have the money to cover an ER bill even if it ends up being unnecessary.

,,,,"You are allowed to call 911 and an ambulance comes to get her. The 911 operator will ask you questions, you just answer with the facts. 

The advantage of ambulance is they can start IV fluids right away, if anyone is leaking blood at a dangerous rate, at a certain point the empty blood vessels can start to get collapsed like sn empty gogurt tube, get sticky and clot. Thats really bad fir your brain, lungs, heart, etc.

When they start a saline IV drip bag, the fluids fluff up the blood vessels, like holding the empty gogurt tube so tap water fills it and props it open.

The IV fluids are a stop gap until they can get an order (emergency prescription) for a blood transfusion. 

The other nice thing about 911 / the ambulance is that if they think she is bleeding to death, THEY can radio ahead to the hospital in order to get an ER operation room available, and have type O blood brought to her as they run cart to the OR.

Ambulances don't have to stop at traffic lights or park... and the ambulance pull in spot has people ready & waiting to ""catch"" patients coming in with trauma. 

The EMT's on the ambulance also travel in pairs or more... so the team can lift her and carry her through a building or down stairs as needed, one person (you) can not carry a grown person well. 

These advantages of ambulances mean a trip that could take you 25 minutes traveling her from the bathroom to the ER... the ambulance can accomplish in under 10. 

If a person is bleeding to death, every minute really counts. For example, the lack of oxygen can start to cause permanent brain damage in like 10 minutes depending on various variables.

Usually the Ambulances will offer a ride either with them or a cop car... this is so you don't get into a cash crash driving all stressed.

You would wait at the hospital to answer questions, because your sister may pass out and the staff wants/needs hints from an awake person.

You will likely be there for 4 hours to overnight. At some point when things are stable, you would have a chance to go pick up phone chargers, and and other sundries, like glasses, entertainment objects, snacks or an overnight kit.

Dark, Loose Yoga pants or sweat pants or shorts with a fold down waist is ideal, but any stretch pants are good. Same with bra and underwear.

These choices are best because she will need clean (not bloody) clothes to return home in. If you are dying, sometimes the cut the clothes away to save time. Her inner elbow/ arm may have an IV tube or a bruise where the IV attached. If she has abdominal surgery, she could have several small 2"" cuts or one longer one... Fresh incisions are tender, firm clothing  like jeans with a zipper may pinch or rub painfully even though the wounds will have gauss and tape covering them.

If she doesn't have an overnight kit, and must stay at the hospital... they will provide objects like toothpaste, lip balm, shampoo, lotion, socks, etc. So don't bother going on a hunt for these if she doesn't keep a travel kit packed & ready.",12.0,"['you', 'are', 'allowed', 'to', 'call', 'and', 'an', 'ambulance', 'come', 'to', 'get', 'her', 'the', 'operator', 'will', 'ask', 'you', 'question', 'you', 'just', 'answer', 'with', 'the', 'fact', 'the', 'advantage', 'of', 'ambulance', 'is', 'they', 'can', 'start', 'iv', 'fluid', 'right', 'away', 'if', 'anyone', 'is', 'leaking', 'blood', 'at', 'a', 'dangerous', 'rate', 'at', 'a', 'certain', 'point', 'the', 'empty', 'blood', 'vessel', 'can', 'start', 'to', 'get', 'collapsed', 'like', 'sn', 'empty', 'gogurt', 'tube', 'get', 'sticky', 'and', 'clot', 'thats', 'really', 'bad', 'fir', 'your', 'brain', 'lung', 'heart', 'etc', 'when', 'they', 'start', 'a', 'saline', 'iv', 'drip', 'bag', 'the', 'fluid', 'fluff', 'up', 'the', 'blood', 'vessel', 'like', 'holding', 'the', 'empty', 'gogurt', 'tube', 'so', 'tap', 'water', 'fill', 'it', 'and', 'prop', 'it', 'open', 'the', 'iv', 'fluid', 'are', 'a', 'stop', 'gap', 'until', 'they', 'can', 'get', 'an', 'order', 'emergency', 'prescription', 'for', 'a', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'the', 'other', 'nice', 'thing', 'about', 'the', 'ambulance', 'is', 'that', 'if', 'they', 'think', 'she', 'is', 'bleeding', 'to', 'death', 'they', 'can', 'radio', 'ahead', 'to', 'the', 'hospital', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'get', 'an', 'er', 'operation', 'room', 'available', 'and', 'have', 'type', 'o', 'blood', 'brought', 'to', 'her', 'a', 'they', 'run', 'cart', 'to', 'the', 'or', 'ambulance', 'do', 'have', 'to', 'stop', 'at', 'traffic', 'light', 'or', 'park', 'and', 'the', 'ambulance', 'pull', 'in', 'spot', 'ha', 'people', 'ready', 'waiting', 'to', 'catch', 'patient', 'coming', 'in', 'with', 'trauma', 'the', 'emt', 'on', 'the', 'ambulance', 'also', 'travel', 'in', 'pair', 'or', 'more', 'so', 'the', 'team', 'can', 'lift', 'her', 'and', 'carry', 'her', 'through', 'a', 'building', 'or', 'down', 'stair', 'a', 'needed', 'one', 'person', 'you', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'a', 'grown', 'person', 'well', 'these', 'advantage', 'of', 'ambulance', 'mean', 'a', 'trip', 'that', 'could', 'take', 'you', 'minute', 'traveling', 'her', 'from', 'the', 'bathroom', 'to', 'the', 'er', 'the', 'ambulance', 'can', 'accomplish', 'in', 'under', 'if', 'a', 'person', 'is', 'bleeding', 'to', 'death', 'every', 'minute', 'really', 'count', 'for', 'example', 'the', 'lack', 'of', 'oxygen', 'can', 'start', 'to', 'cause', 'permanent', 'brain', 'damage', 'in', 'like', 'minute', 'depending', 'on', 'various', 'variable', 'usually', 'the', 'ambulance', 'will', 'offer', 'a', 'ride', 'either', 'with', 'them', 'or', 'a', 'cop', 'car', 'this', 'is', 'so', 'you', 'do', 'get', 'into', 'a', 'cash', 'crash', 'driving', 'all', 'stressed', 'you', 'would', 'wait', 'at', 'the', 'hospital', 'to', 'answer', 'question', 'because', 'your', 'sister', 'may', 'pas', 'out', 'and', 'the', 'staff', 'hint', 'from', 'an', 'awake', 'person', 'you', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'there', 'for', 'hour', 'to', 'overnight', 'at', 'some', 'point', 'when', 'thing', 'are', 'stable', 'you', 'would', 'have', 'a', 'chance', 'to', 'go', 'pick', 'up', 'phone', 'charger', 'and', 'and', 'other', 'sundries', 'like', 'glass', 'entertainment', 'object', 'snack', 'or', 'an', 'overnight', 'kit', 'during', 'this', 'break', 'go', 'get', 'a', 'comfortable', 'change', 'of', 'clothes', 'for', 'her', 'stretchy', 'with', 'no', 'sleeve', 'if', 'she', 'ha', 'a', 'stretchy', 'short', 'sleeve', 'shirt', 'in', 'a', 'dark', 'color', 'that', 'is', 'ideal', 'dark', 'loose', 'yoga', 'pant', 'or', 'sweat', 'pant', 'or', 'short', 'with', 'a', 'fold', 'down', 'waist', 'is', 'ideal', 'but', 'any', 'stretch', 'pant', 'are', 'good', 'same', 'with', 'bra', 'and', 'underwear', 'these', 'choice', 'are', 'best', 'because', 'she', 'will', 'need', 'clean', 'not', 'bloody', 'clothes', 'to', 'return', 'home', 'in', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'dying', 'sometimes', 'the', 'cut', 'the', 'clothes', 'away', 'to', 'save', 'time', 'her', 'inner', 'arm', 'may', 'have', 'an', 'iv', 'tube', 'or', 'a', 'bruise', 'where', 'the', 'iv', 'attached', 'if', 'she', 'ha', 'abdominal', 'surgery', 'she', 'could', 'have', 'several', 'small', 'cut', 'or', 'one', 'longer', 'one', 'fresh', 'incision', 'are', 'tender', 'firm', 'clothing', 'like', 'jean', 'with', 'a', 'zipper', 'may', 'pinch', 'or', 'rub', 'painfully', 'even', 'though', 'the', 'wound', 'will', 'have', 'gauss', 'and', 'tape', 'covering', 'them', 'if', 'she', 'doe', 'have', 'an', 'overnight', 'kit', 'and', 'must', 'stay', 'at', 'the', 'hospital', 'they', 'will', 'provide', 'object', 'like', 'toothpaste', 'lip', 'balm', 'shampoo', 'lotion', 'sock', 'etc', 'so', 'do', 'bother', 'going', 'on', 'a', 'hunt', 'for', 'these', 'if', 'she', 'doe', 'keep', 'a', 'travel', 'kit', 'packed', 'ready']"

Well, I knew what I was doing that evening! A little pre-dinner ER! I grabbed a bunch of the mushrooms and sent a picture to a friend who forages wild mushrooms. She said they were almost certainly an edible species but go to the ER in case. Some liver enzyme tests and some activated charcoal and everything was good.

Ironically the same reason that relatives make good organ donor candidates, high likelihood that you inherited similar MHC genes (also called HLA), actually makes it more likely for a problem to occur (though there's procedures to avoid that problem occurring at all so you'd be fine if they have something to do them).

Red blood cells and platelets don't have MHCs which is why donating blood is so much easier than organs. You just need to match blood type. But there's also white cells in blood. Almost every time you donate blood your immune system will see the donor white cells as foreign and kill them. A very small amount of the time the MHC genes will be similar enough that they'll each see eachother as the same and be fine. But a very very small amount of the time the MHC genes will be close but not quite matches and your cells see them as fine, but they see you as foreign and start attacking you. If you're related the later two are more likely.

,,,,"The problem is actually specifically because their MHCs (HLA) might be close matches. Your RBCs and platelets don't have MHCs and you don't need the donor's white blood cells. That's why for blood it's type matters but MHC matching isn't needed like for organs. The vast majority of the time your body will see them as foreign and kill them. A very small amount of the time they'll think each looks similar enough to the other that it's fine. A very small amount of the time your body won't see them as foreign but they will see you as foreign and start attacking you.

I would suggest watching a couple videos on TikTok or YouTube of men trying a period stimulator to see how painful they are. Really nice of you to help her clean up and get her a blanket etc. Periods are horrible and they can make you have bad pain, sore breasts, acne, trouble sleeping, nausea, diarrhea, and make you super emotional and cranky etc 

So a pad is a strip basically that goes in someone’s underwear that has a sticky side that sticks to the underwear. They can come in a very thin pad for before you get your period or at the very end. All the way up to these huge, thick pads that are basically like diapers for heavy flow/overnight.

A tampon is basically a piece of cotton with a string attached to it that usually comes in a plastic applicator. A woman inserts it into her vagina and pushes on the applicator. This releases only the cotton into her vagina. The string is pulled and a new tampon should be replaced every 4-8 hours. 

There are also period plastic silicone cups that can be inserted into the vagina and even things like reusable pads. 

A period is caused by monthly shedding of the uterus which results in vaginal bleeding.

Tips for women in your life when they are on their period: Be kind and understanding. Sorry we are so crazy with our periods, we can’t help it! A heating pad and chocolate are usually really wonderful.

He thought that and *still* refused to take her to an ER? By your own point it sounds far, far worse He came here first. I made my point and left it be from there. More people are harassing me than I ever harassed him especially since mine wasn't harassment.

,,,,"Thanks. IMHO, the ""sex talk"" stuff is really supposed to be 100 little 5 minute lessons, where you have to catch those moments of curiosity when they happen - lol.

I'm pretty sure my lil dude only got curious because he overheard some peers on a video game smack talking each other and the word tampon came up, so he asked about em. 

Then on of the peers had heard an rumor that in real life, soldiers can use tampons to plug a bullet hole in combat.  

So my kiddo had some questions about tampons, almost like video game stats.

So I got out a couple types, plus panty liners, pads, pads with wings... the whole kit. And talked about normal use, and let him unwrap them, and see how much water they hold.

Someday he's gonna live with a lady, have a wife, maybe have daughters... like half the people in the world are chics... so it's worth knowing something about.

And thanks to reddit, I was locked & loaded to clearup some confusion that seems common;

Number of holes, how & when pregnancy can happen, how each women's cycle is individual and varies a lot in the begging and tail end of having periods, type age of onset, and menopause, that pads stick to CLOTHING, not the person like a bandaid, and some people barely notice the discomfort & some people get so sick it's like diarrhea cramping for 5 days a month. Even simply stuff like periods are supposed to start and only last a week, so if you know someone who has one that starts and keeps bleeding for 3+ weeks in a row, they need a doctor, etc.

My kiddo is really bright & resourceful, so I want to make sure I give him ""news you can use"" so that if he has friends that ask him stuff, he's a good source of info instead of more confusion.

The other thing that worked good is to get BOTH the boys and girls books for the topic of puberty. Their are lots on amazon that are age appropriate, I think the ones I got were from the same publisher that makes the American Girls Dolls series... 

The kiddo was VERY interested in both books. I periodically see they have been moved in his room over the years, so I think he is going back to them like reference books.

For you to paraphrase this the way you did lacks context. I'm not sure if it's context you weren't following, or if you did it on purpose, but it's not like she said this in a vacuum.
She was responding to someone who told her to ""be helpful or be quiet,"" to which she said it wasn't her problem that they didn't view it as helpful. The person gave ""feedback,"" but in general, it wasn't helpful feedback. It didn't consider the purpose or content of her post, because it considered her tone ""too harsh"" for an adult.

-you've had your period for a lil bit now and never experienced this before (this one I do recognize is an assumption because it's never said if she's had similar) 

-you go through 3 pads in what if I mapped right is less than 3 hours or so. To the point it's going down your leg

-you expelled a clot the size of a hacky sack as OP describe, which is roughly the size of one of those cutie oranges 

-you feel like you're going to vomit, likely expressly lightheaded and dizzy (op mentioned in a comment his sisters BP was 70-something over 54 when the docs checked so that likely caused some sensation 

-your heart rate is 133 which is equivalent of running on a treadmill, while laying down. May not have immediate numbers but you will feel that trying to escape your chest

-you go to the bathroom and proceed to have more blood clots that from the sound of it aren't tiny (by tiny I mean a usd quarter or smaller) 

-the bleeding does not appear to be stopping and if I estimating the time right was going on for at least 3-5 hours with no stop in sight, maybe more if you count the reddit post and the extra hour between ""okay were going"" to ""okay were here."" 

-and the people responsible for your medical bills have had enough money to travel internationally for roughly a week (he says 6 days but a half day for prep and travel to the airport pre boarding to destination and back) 

And you would still not even attempt an urgent care at the least if not an ER? Would you go if it was your daughter experiencing this and she never had before? Or lets say you have a sister in this scenerio youre caring for, would you hesitate? No alarms would be going off at all? No thought to call a local doctor you or who your caring for sees? 
Or even this...would you Google it? Because in my original comment I edited to add that part of my concern is posts on here have gone unanswered before for hours. 

My other concern with it was women tend to not be believed or trusted to know what's going on with their bodies, especially from men. Especially around our periods and reproductive organ issues. We get conditioned to brush even scary stuff off and it's because of situations like this where a dad or older brother or doctor had the same attitude OP did (which he did admit he wasnt taking it seripusly in another comment). Her own brother was showing her that she won't be believed when she really needs help and based on her stats she *really* needed help. I have some faith in the world that based on his comments he learned from it and recognizes he messed up. Like...something in my soul settled down seeing he owned his mistake. But I genuiely am struggling to understand how when it's that many symptoms someone wouldn't go ""money be damned they got payment programs"" and try to at least go to the first least expensive option possible.

Also to really quickly add, if your period is subject to change after about the first two years or so it's that something is throwing it off. Maybe not howany days but the time clock should be pretty on schedule and flow fairly consistent. I've been monitoring my daughter's since they got it and her doctors have confirmed there's something off because even for the 1st two years it's very very off.

,,,,"I completely understand your concerns, but I can also totally see why OP googled for advice. I don’t think it’s that he didn’t believe her, I think it was more like he struggled to compute bc it’s not what he expected an emergency to look like. I used to babysit my siblings/cousins a lot when I was younger, and short of something that very clearly required police/ambos/firies, my idea of an emergency would have involved some kind external injury. Bleeding out from my vagina wouldn’t have even made my list of possible scenarios. And tbh, even if it were on the list, sometimes it can still take a second to sink in. When I was 15 and my brother (14) sliced his hand with a knife and ended up needing stitches, my reply to him when he asked me to call mum back (she has left home literally 5 minutes earlier) wasn’t “okay, I’ll call mum”, it was “call mum? Why? what do you mean you stabbed yourself? How? Oh, guess I should call mum. Just sit down and stop freaking out”. Obviously that was not the appropriate response, but it wasn’t that I didn’t believe he hurt himself, I just couldn’t process quickly enough to respond better. Both my mum and brother still poke fun at me occasionally for sounding like I was annoyed at the inconvenience hahah. 

Also, I can offer another perspective on your hypothetical situation. I do want to be clear that I’m not at all intending to contradict your point that there are definite red flags for just going to emergency. But from personal experience, I can see how some of the lines get blurred. 

I’ve had my period for 15 years, and it has never been regular. If I experience something new, my response is “huh, that’s a new one”, and I’ll note it down just in case (but even that’s a relatively new habit). 

I didn’t realise that my periods were actually pretty heavy until after I got a mirena when I was 22 in hope that’d make them stop (it didn’t, but they are much much lighter) bc I hated dealing with them. Not to the extent of OP’s sister, but clots and it running down my leg were normal for me. I genuinely thought I was just really bad at managing them and felt insecure about it. The only upside was that I never got cramps (unfortunately, the mirena gave me those, but I’ll take it over the constant fear that I’m leaking though my pants every time I feel a clot come out, or having blood run down my leg just after I’ve showered).

My resting heart rate is over 100bpm. I’m pretty healthy, ECGs I’ve had look fine. GP says that’s just my normal.

Again, I totally get where you’re coming from.

I'm not sure how to break this to you but just because it's normal due to doctors dismissal of those girls you spoke to doesn't mean it's actually normal. There's two normals, the one where it's supposed to be like something and no problems and the one where it's clearly a sign something is off but is downplayed so much the people experiencing it ""normalize"" it to cope with it. 

Endometriosis can definitely send you to the ER if it's not treated because it can become an issue. Same with PCOS, they're called disorders or illnesses for a reason. 

I honestly think the younger generation has just been conditioned too strongly to think things aren't as big a deal as they actually are and I think lots of schools and doctors are to blame for it but my *whole* original point to my original comment is *OPs sister knew it was an emergency and told him that and he didn't believe her and that is the issue.* she knew, she was together and educated enough to know and he dismissed her originally.

The doctor would explain that it's for acne, not for contraception. Yes, some people are still opposed to birth control as a blanket rule, but that's not the norm. It's certainly possible, but all /u/mmbbccnn  said was that it was *most likely* that she'd be taking the OCP as well.

You're human, and you're gonna make mistakes no matter how old you are.  Even my SO and I had a moment last year when we wrestled between taming my 14yo stepdaughter to urgent care or the ER.  Because the ER is not somewhere you feel like you should reflexively go to if you're not sure it's truly an emergency, I get it.

On that note, that's something to think about on the future. If something is wrong medically and you're not sure, during regular office hours you can call your regular doctor and they can usually advise you based on what you say is wrong.  If you can't reach them, you can look up local urgent care doctor offices and call them.  Often times, both of these choices have nurses on staff to talk to patients over the phone and help determine how serious a situation is and what the patient should do.

But bottom line, no matter what, i promise any nurse, doctor, or parent worth a damn will not be angry at you for choosing to go to the ER just in case.

I am absolutely sure you don't hate your sister.  If you ask me, that's a million percent obvious.  And I don't feel like you were ""mansplaining"" or anything as some have said.  You were just trying not to panic and overreact, and that's entirely understandable.

And I don't blame you for being tired and starting yo react to the assholes.  You've had a long ass day or two with this, I'm sure.  Take a breath and remind yourself not to let them get to you, they don't matter.  Your sister matters, and I'm sure she loved and appreciates you.

,,,,"You do know that link is a blog from a store, right? And your FDA quote has nothing to do with tampons *causing* UTIs. It is simply saying that if you *already have* a UTI, use a pad.


If we're just going to quote from random blogs, at least here is one from an OBGYN practice [https://rockvilleobgyn.com/blog/uti-myths/] : 


""**If You Use Tampons, You Are at an Increased Risk**


""Using tampons does not actually increase your risk of developing a UTI. In fact, tampons can actually help to prevent a UTI. This is because they are designed to absorb moisture and keep the external area as dry as possible. Since bacteria thrive in moist environments, tampons actually manage bacterial populations by keeping the area dry.""


And then, for a more credible source, the American Urology Association Journal 
https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000000296 (edit to add this link wasn't working, not sure if I fixed it, but if not the article is ""Recurrent Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections in Women: AUA/CUA/SUFU Guideline"") 


""Unfortunately, there are many commonly held myths surrounding lifestyle modification. Case-control studies clearly demonstrate that changes in hygiene practices (front to back wiping), pre- and post-coital voiding, avoidance of hot tubs, tampon use, and douching, do not play a role in rUTI prevention.""


You keep commenting that people are believing doctors or certain websites over you. Well, yeah. Your personal experience, or what you believe it to be, does not make something a fact. I can say, ""hey, I got a UTI from eating Raisin Bran!"" but that doesn't make it true, and it doesn't mean that people should believe me over a trained medical professional because it's my ""lived experience."" That is not how medicine or science in general works. 


I cannot imagine this conversation is going to progress much beyond this as, judging from your other comments, you are convinced of what you believe to be true.

We saw doctors for months and months with no answers only scary “maybes”. On paper he was healthy but started to lose his ability to walk, hold things and basically function as a normal kid. 

Desperate for answers I wrote everything out here. I’ve since deleted the post since it included personal details. In 10 minutes I had two physicians tell me it was Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. Two hospitalizations later (the first telling us he did NOT have JIA and most likely had a form of MD) we finally got diagnosed with JIA. We started treatment and two weeks later he was better, 6 months later walking with no limp at all and today almost a year later free of all disease activity.

I’ve kept screenshots of it, they were moderators telling me NOT to go to the ER making me feel stupid. At eosinophil of 5800. So yeah. I’m not lying about the post I just deleted it because of anxiety before the hospital trip because I thought I was dumb about everything. 

Don’t know if you remember. I’m 24F and my post got a lot of discussion under it due to its nature (hypereosinophilia, vaping marijuana, etc). 

There was only one doctor (@BmoresFnst) who pushed for me to see heme at eosinophil of 5.8, which had been ranging between 1.9-2.2 for six-eight months prior w no follow up (range: 0.0-0.5). 

Everyone else told me it’s b/c of the vaping. Well, I ended up in the ER for six days and I went thru a bone marrow biopsy and all sorts of imaging and everything, the  heme at the ER told me vaping cannot cause those levels - turns out I had lupus and now I’m on 5 different medications just to control it. They found the eosinophilia just in time too and my organs were fine. Also so many different doctors. Also still vaping (nothing helps with the pain not even Imuran…)

So… yeah. Thanks to that doctor. And this sub. That’s all.

Edit: For those wondering, my current medication is pregabalin 75 mg twice a day, prednisone 20 mg everyday after a depo medrol 250 mg 2 injection situation 3 weeks ago, imuran (200 mg i think. or is it 150? it’s two pills. i just know that) and hydroxychloroquin 200 mg 2x a day!

edit 2: ok we’re back to diagnosis in process cuz i’m hypereosinophilic off the steroids. we don’t know what’s going on and bone marrow just says 20%> eosinophil…",,,[]

,,,,"Kudos to you for saving and changing someone’s life. It sounds like you know alot about lupus so I was wondering if you thought I should try to get a work up for that or other autoimmune conditions. I was super healthy (personal trainer three times a week, walked 5-7 miles a day with my dog, ate healthy, played tennis, didn’t drink or smoke) prior to getting hit with a few unfortunate things back to back. This includes some sort of illness while traveling which, in retrospect, I probably should have treated (we shared meal after which my husband ended up with inflamed appendix on IV meds in the ER but they told me if I was just having GI issues my immune system should take care of it). And then Covid. But since then I’ve had host of vague symptoms. Started with extreme fatigue and muscle weakness and then vomiting after any kind of workout. I thought maybe it was hormones but that was normal. Then I thought maybe I’m just burnt out so I took a brief sabbatical from my job (since it is very demanding) but that didn’t help and during that time I also started developing joint pain and hair loss as well as prominent veins. Then all of a sudden I woke up with extreme bladder and back pain. And ever since I’ve been worked up with a number of differentials but the findings all vague. I have bladder wall thickening, mild prominence of right renal pelvis, etc. my doctors said it could be interstitial cystitis but that I don’t really fit neatly into that bucket (no urgency and frequency, no urethral burning, no small bladder capacity, normal voiding) and that it doesn’t really explain other symptoms. 

Saw top IC doc in country (who does a ton of research and sees patients from all over and usually seems to diagnose everyone he sees with IC) and even he wasn’t convinced it was IC (although he said it is possible with just an abnormal or complex case). Everything is worse when I sit or stand in one place. Basically helps to lay flat. Or sometimes a little bit of just pacing or walking. I’ve failed all of the traditional meds for IC and pelvic floor physical therapy for pelvic floor dysfunction (I do if daily just incase and PT says no more tightness or trigger points). 

I just feel like my bladder is swollen and painful. And my back really hurts even though no real pathological findings on lumbar spine MRI beyond cluster of tarvlov cysts which often aren’t considered symptomatic but againn I guess a very small chance they could be implicated but one would think I’d have urinary retention or urgency and frequency. My stools also changed and got thinner at the same time. 

So if feels like there may be just local inflammation or bladder and/ bowels (maybe GI inflammation irritating bladder) or something is attacking my tissue. I have very high blood marker for MMP-9 (I guess involved in tissue remodeling) but the other basic markers to check for inflammation or autoimmunity are normal (ANA,  hlb-27, ESR, CRP). Only other things showing as out of range in the more extensive panels I’ve gotten are super high total IGE (no classic allergy symptoms at all though), high acetylcholine, high EBV titers, and high cortisol (both blood serum and 24 hour). Sporadically out of range WBC. Always trends in high normal but sporadically moves to out of range. High neutrophils (on edge of normal). So maybe my body is still fighting some sort of infection? Even though not showing up on urinalysis or the basic stool tests given by PCP. 

Or maybe I should attempt a more complete workup for autoimmune issue? It looks like lupus can rarely but sometimes present as bladder cystitis and affect kidneys? My kidney function is okay but not as great as you would think it would be for my age, overall health (or at least before this), weight (normal BMI - on thinner side at 5’5 and 105lbs), and risk factors. But kidneys look okay on ultrasound. 

Idk I guess I worry I’m showing early warning signs of something but maybe it just hasn’t gotten full blown enough to be fully detectable or diagnosable? The bladder and back pain are fairly crippling though. 

Sorry this is a long dissertation but thought I’d check to see if you think it might be worth it or other tests I should try. I’m basically bed ridden working 10-12 hours a day from a desk bed setup and then otherwise in hot bath or lying with heating pads while my poor husband has to watch me struggle and he has to postpone enjoying his life too or opt out of normal life things we used to do since I can’t really travel, play tennis with him anymore, eat normal meals (to try to see if strict diet can help bladder),

,,,,"Warning, this is a little long, but I don't know how to make this shorter.. 

NAD but just an FYI, if the Lyrica (pregabalin) doesn't seem to be helping after you have been on a therapeutic level for a while, you may want to try gabapentin. I'm thinking your Lyrica may have to go up some to get to the level where they say it isn't working for you. I also have an autoimmune disorder (Psoriatic Arthritis) and I take gabapentin. I'm not sure it is working that well for me so my doc and I are going to change me to Lyrica in the near future and try that. I had a blood infection a couple of months ago and was in the hospital and we want to wait until I am on therapeutic levels of my biologic again before switching anything.

For many people it seems that both Lyrica and gabapentin are the kind of meds that you really don't feel like they are working, but if you have to stop them, you realize they were helping. From numerous people I know that are on one or the other of the two meds, it also seems like one may work for them but the other doesn't. My cousin tried Lyrica and it didn't work for her but gabapentin did. I have another cousin that was just the opposite. With a new autoimmune diagnosis it can also take a while of ups and downs until you get to the levels of meds that are right for you. I wish I had done what I'm about to tell you when I was first diagnosed, but you really should keep a pain diary right now because you are on several new meds. Also if things are working well for you, make sure your doc does what mine did.. Only change one med at a time. If you change (stop/add a med, up/lower a dosage amount) of more than one at a time, it's hard to tell which one worked/didn't work. It can be a hard process in the beginning because there are so many changes at once with all the new meds but once you get everything where it needs to be, lupus can be controlled and you are very fortunate that they diagnosed you at your age. That means they can prevent damage that happens when it takes a lot time to get a diagnosis. I wish I had been diagnosed that early in life because I've already had a lot of joint damage. Also lupus can damage your kidneys so it is great they diagnosed yours at your age.

Make sure your rheumatologist does frequent blood work (many don't) because some od your meds and/or disease can do some liver and/or kidney damage so they need to keep a watch on that. My doc does my blood work every 3 to 4 months.

Something else that is really important for the plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) can cause damage to your eyes so you need to see an eye doctor regularly. Not an optometrist, but an ophthalmologist. It is preferable to see one that deals with autoimmune disorders and the medications required to treat them. Also with any autoimmune disorder, a lot of people will have a second one. Many will get uveitis, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the eyes. The problems that you could have with your eyes while taking plaquenil are problems that the ophthalmologist would see before you have symptoms of a problem. You must go at least yearly and your eye doc may suggest you do it more often. The good thing about that is your insurance should pay for those eye exams even when basic eye exams aren't covered by insurance, since this is a medical issue and not a regular eye exam. Just don't let that go if your doc doesn't tell you that you need it. You do. You can Google ""plaquenil and eye exams"" and you will find you must do this.

If you have any questions for someone dealing daily with an autoimmune disorder, please feel free to contact me. Just DM me and I will be glad to help you with dealing with this day to day. Even though I have a different autoimmune disorder, there are a lot of similarities with many of them, especially ones that are inflammatory arthritis, which lupus and psoriatic arthritis both are. I know you don't feel fortunate right now because you have been diagnosed with a chronic illness, but you are so very fortunate they caught it when you are 23 instead is when you are 43 and have tons of damage and even worse pain. I also find that weed helps my pain more than anything, but my current pain doc doesn't allow it (my old one did). Once you get to therapeutic levels of the medication cocktail that is right for you, your pain won't stop but it will get better and easier to control.

Good luck! Don't forget you can contact me anytime!

ETA: You really need to talk to your doc about the daily prednisone. I realize that sometimes we all have to take it (personally I find the medrol dose pack works better for me and you take it less than a week). Prednisone is not a benign medication. There are numerous issues that can come from daily pred or even taking it a lot but not daily, at the dosage you are taking. You are already on two medications (plaquenil and imuran) that lower your immune system (which autoimmune disorders require) and prednisone is a third. You can get serious infections. If there is anyway you can not take prednisone every day, that would be great and better for you. It may be that your doctor is planning on lowering your pred after some of your other meds get to therapeutic levels. Just be aware, prednisone can help a lot with pain but it can cause some serious problems, so be sure and discuss the pred with your doctor and find out what their plan is for taking that. Please try to work with your doctor to not have to take it regularly if possible.",4.0,"['warning', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'little', 'long', 'but', 'i', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'to', 'make', 'this',

,,,,"Am curious about your symptoms. I have been struggling since a covid infection with palpitations, dizziness, increased fatigue (already diagnosed with fibromyalgia and sleep apnea with hypersomnia). I feel so awful in the mornings and have difficulty walking. My legs feel weak and I am utterly exhausted.

I have difficulty with tandem walking (one foot in front of the other). Recently, told I have golfer's elbow and something else (both inside and outer epichondyl of elbows sore). Plantar fasciitis and heel pain on both feet. 

My physiatrist (Dr. Of Physical Medicine and rehab) saw pictures of a face rash that will disappear in 20 mins to an hour but burns like a sunburn. I am diagnosed with rosecea but I had clusters of pimples that lasted for days with it. The physiatrist wants me to see a doctor to check for lupus vs. Rosecea.

I found out my old rheumatologist left the state. I put off making appointments because I started with Neurology and the last doctor put in her notes that I should stop seeing neuro sub-specialists and be managed by my sleep doctor whose office keeps delaying my appointments. (Sept to May to now October). I was too tired to explain how I was referred around and just doing what I was told to do. Why waste half an appointment telling her that I was ""entitled"" to be seen? 

Having a fibromyalgia diagnosis, I see new doctors making up their minds before they walk in the door.

I am tired of the medical system and am thinking of trying supplements. Many people I know who have fibromyalgia have stopped riding the medi-go-round.
